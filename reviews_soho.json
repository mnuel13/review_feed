Service was fast despite the restaurant being pretty busy, which was another plus and hard to find often on a Saturday night in london!Food was incredible, as two steak lovers we are quite picky but we were more than impressed and the cut of steak recommend by staff was one of the best I\u2019ve had in london. The manager even came over at the end to see how we enjoyed our meal which was a really nice touch.All in all I can 100% recommend this place, and we will definitely be coming back!",

        "Review: I\u2019ve dining at Macellaio in South Kensington for 12 years, having relocated abroad came back to London on business trip. Wanted to get back to South Kensington but at the end realised that Macellaio had opened at SOHO just 4 minutes walk from my hotel hence booked there for a business dinner without hesitation. The booking services allocated us at the upper floor, nice ambiance, I have to say much nicer than the South Kensington branch, however the experience started to derail, immediately after we ordered starters, main and wine. Starters arrived with water, we had to call for wine twice and eventually arrived 10 minutes after we had finished our starters. Then we waited for around 30 minutes for the Fassona ribeye to be served. This has always been the order for me for the last 12 years Fassona ribeye and Cir\u00f2 Librandi Red. The wine was as usual up to expectations, the meat was full of fat we could barely find decent portion of flesh for two considering also that it comes with the bone\u2026we were starving after the wait and we could have ordered more if it wasn\u2019t for the, wait\u2026, I\u2019ve done this a couple of times at South Kensington when we were dining in a small group, but this time decided avoid and order dessert. My business partner went for tiramis\u00f9 I decided to go for gelato nocciola. The dessert came and once my business partner started to eat it I could see dismay in his face to a point that I decided to test his tiramis\u00f9 to understand what was wrong. It was sour, we sent it back and asked the chef to test it. Well the waiter told us that erroneously the savoiardi biscuits were poured with Worcester sauce instead of coffee!!! Apologies of course and replaced with another, which at the end wasn\u2019t added to the bill. Two reflections: 1. I expect tiramis\u00f9 in an Italian restaurant to be done well before serving and not express with few savoiardi poured with coffee and topped with mascarpone cream. 2. How can be possible to experience such an error in a restaurant that at the end charges you \u00a3100+ each! It goes without saying that 20% service charge for a total mess with the waiting and lack of attention, including meat being served after 30 min without new plates on the table, having to ask for salt shouting to be heard, it\u2019s a robbery. I\u2019ll be back in London and go to South Kensington to check if it is an overall disaster, for now would suggest candidly to avoid SOHO branch. Best of luck!Dined on Oct 6 2022.",

I recommend sitting at the counter to watch the chef cook your steaks on the charcoal grill with a flare that seems more artistry than cooking. Our meal started with bruschetta and porchetta. I wouldn\u2019t normally have ordered the porchetta, but it was recommended and did not disappoint. This was followed by rib eye steak, which I got rare. The steak was perfectly cooked. Sides included fresh greens with a tarragon dressing and chips. The latter were based on the recipe of a Michelin chef \u2026 these were no ordinary fries. Desserts included freshly made hazelnut gelato and tiramisu made at the table. This meal was a treat from entry into the restaurant to the last bite of tiramisu.

        "Review: I am still excited after spending a wonderful evening at the Macellaio restaurant in Soho. The location is nothing short of wonderful, it looks like a theatre in which the protagonist is meat, of excellent quality and which will be cooked perfectly before your eyes. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming and warm, you'll be enchanted. I participated in an event in which each dish served was expertly paired with wines from Domenico Clerico's winery, one of the greatest innovators of the oenological world in Italy.I let myself be carried away by flavours and aromas presented with great refinement but, at the same time, I always felt at ease, pampered by smiles and tales as if I were at the table among friends always known.I only have one piece of advice to give you: DO NOT miss a dinner at the Macellaio restaurant\u2026 I'm sure you can't wait to replicate dozens of times the food and wine experience that they will give you.[INVITE]My review: FOOD: very high quality of ingredients prepared and combined with art. Excellent wine cellar. ENVIRONMENT: really nice, it looks like the projection of a theatre with a stage in the centre in which one of the most important acts of your evening takes place... the fascinating ritual of grilling meat PRICE: medium-high\u200d STAFF / SERVICE: you'll meet only kindness, smiles and the desire to share stories and anecdotes with great (and deserved!) pride LOCATION: there are 6 restaurants in London, I've been to Soho (39-45 Shaftesbury Avenue, Lodon W1D 6lA)OVERALL ... every bite of special dishes and every sip of wine will give you incredible emotions",

        "Review: The worst steakhouse experience I\u2019ve ever had. The oyster starter of \u00a316 clams with 2 tasteless oysters served cold with hot bone marrow - this churns the tummy not in a good way. The ribeye was tough & too heavy. The price is about \u00a310 per 100g and this includes the bone, we ordered a 600g to share which after the bone was about 150g or \u00a330 per person. The sides of courgette are served I\u2019ve cold which is awful with a hot steak. Our table was wobbly which made the entire experience stressful and the chianti was acidic. This place is a total tourist trap - avoid !",

        "Review: Did I go to the same restaurant as the other reviewers on here ? I thought it was a disappointment .My family and I booked this as the high point of a three day stay . We had eaten the most incredible costars di manzo ( bone in rib eye) in Umbria four years ago and wanted to recreate the experience .Online I found this amazing looking steakhouse which does costata di manzo and has rave reviews . So I booked it.We were told on arrival that we had the table for two hours . Would have appreciated being told that when I booked ? Didn't like the way it was said, but I'm probably being sensitive . We wanted to go for the steak for three of us. It came , and looked thrillingly delicious . The problem was, it was quite tough in places . Not all places , but in quite a few of them . And chef had been too generous with the sea salt . It wasn't inedible , but it was over salted .The meat itself had a nice flavour .But the chips were an abomination . Very poor . Horribly dried out . To guess, they had been precooked and reheated . Or they were frozen. They were not a worthy accompaniment to steak, and for four of us the chips cost \u00a322. They were exceptionally poor abs looked like they had soaked up a lot of oil .The other accompaniments were fine .My wine by the glass was not enough in quantity . I've never seen such a small glass of wine .We ordered desserts . The kids had macedoine of mixed fruits with lemon marshmallows . The latter were terrible , they tasted of raw flour . The fruit was under ripe in the main and the waitress poured a juice of underripe apricots over everything . Sour and unpleasant My wife ordered",

The attitude of one of the waitresses was dismissive and supercilious and although my fillet steak and sides were fine (not outstanding, and certainly not worth the price, just fine), my partner had to send his back, as his steak was cold and chewy. The manager was initially conciliatory but when the second steak was little better than the first and I gave honest feedback, his attitude became defensive and I also found him sexist. I was paying for the meal, but although I was giving feedback he was primarily addressing my partner (we both got the sense he was looking for an ally - boys together; he didn't find one). The only reason I have given two rather than one as a rating was because there was another waitress, Maria, who tried to resolve the issues and rescue the situation. She was a perfect ambassador for the restaurant, just a shame the others weren't. Definitely not worth the money and not somewhere I would consider returning to.",

Abbiamo ordinato una tartara classica ed una con gorgonzola, eccezionali entrambi ed un tagliere di salumi misti molto buono. A seguire della fassona e del filetto accompagnato con patate al forno, non ci sono parole per descrivere la tenerezza e la bravura nella cottura. Il tutto accompagnato da un buon rosso piemontese, cmq la carta vini spazia per tutte le regioni italiane. Da quello che ho potuto vedere dal men\u00f9, i prezzi sono medio alti pero' ne vale l pena.

The waiter said, \"We have no sauce, this is not a pub\". Note to Macellaio: Never should staff talk to customers in such a rude way.Unimpressed with the food, this was bland, and feel the food was not worth the premium price. We complained to the manager, and he offered us a free drink, to which we declined. Thereafter the service was much improved.

        "Review: We went to Macellaio RC for my birthday. The entire restaurant is gorgeous and the open kitchens - including a great centralised butchery - really made everything atmospheric with tempting sights and smells and the bustle of a busy kitchen.Service was superb, generally efficient and staff were very accommodating to our needs especially as we ended up rushing to meet our post-dinner entertainment.The food was superb but essentially is geared towards meat (only a few chicken, fish dishes available and little in the way of non-meat \\ fish items available). Fine for us but definitely not the place to go for an extensive vegi\\vegan friendly experience. Carpaccio, cured meats and other charcuterie fair were delightful. Whilst portions were large, they left you hankering for the main courses of steak cuts which are the piece de resistance at Macellaio.Seriously, these bad boys are BIG. You're going to want to share, which potentially brings with it some difficulties if your party all have different steak preferences. They also had an inclination towards the rare\\medium-rare side of cooking which made every bite exquisite for me though not necessarily to everyones tastes.Overall I would definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone looking to indulge their carnivorous habits for a fun night out.",

Macellaio is known for the meat dishes and in every location I went the food was excellent, but this restaurant is different from the others as it has a much wider menu which I tried for a change. For the main, I had a fish and a pasta dish, both being delicious and an amazing option for their menu. The starter with mozzarella and tomatoes was toothsome and the desert was incredibly good! The pastry chef at this location is amazing. I was very happy to see the chain evolve and introduce new items for this new location which is very central and convenient to get to.

You enter expecting an excellent meat restaurant because it already enjoys the excellent reputation of the previous restaurants of the same owner, who has staked everything on the Piedmontese Fassona. Here is the growth, the leap, the study and the path that Macellaio has made, very interesting dishes such as Beauty and the Beast that combine the delicate flavor of an oyster with the decisive flavor of the marrow, leaving the palate with an amazing sensation, an explosion of taste. In this restaurant there is a culinary offer of the highest quality, with Italian niche products from excellent producers, which explode on the plate and in the eyes. A particular mention to the meat of which the maturation process it receives is exposed and the chef cuts the piece in front of your eyes giving life to a spectacularity contained in the name. The apricot cheesecake deserves a round of applause on the dessert, of which I do not say anything because it is only to eat.",

        "Review: We went to Macellaio in Soho for a family lunch!The whole experience from start to finish was great!We were greeted by a very friendly and professional staff! The food is absolutely divine: we had various mouthwatering starters and the steak tartare was outstanding but my favourite was La Bella e La Bestia( oysters with charcoaled bone marrow....what a surprise!!!). We shared some Costata and a Fiorentina and the meat was cooked to perfection! Also a great selection of desserts! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we will definitely be back very soon! Grazie!",
