The trofie with pesto \u00a314 (probably 80gr of trofie from a packet for each portion with a poor quantity of average quality pesto) were insipid and we are still waiting for the green beans as they forgot to put them in.I am from Genoa and I understand so the owner, so even more angry with Italians who come to London to rip people offDon\u2019t go there",

Only disappointment, and it is a big one, were the toilets. Clean but unpleasant, as if inconsequential to the overall experience. Disabled toilet closed for repair, tight layout with dated, cheap fittings. Poor layout meant the open door to the mens\u2019 toilet immediately adjacent to the ladies\u2019 one is not what I wanted to see after such a wonderful restaurant experience. Manager was apologetic, understood our disappointment and handled our feedback well. 5 star food and service in a not-inexpensive restaurant, let down by 2star toilet facilities (second star only because they were clean).",

We received a welcoming, friendly greeting from the staff and were sat in a lovely spot, mid restaurant. The menu is heavily meat based, so if you don\u2019t enjoy quality cuts of meat (beef especially) then this may not be quite so appealing to you but there were also great fresh tuna dishes on offer, which I was sorely tempted by too.I ordered the marrowbone topped with steak tartare and pomegranate seeds to start. It looked awesome and tasted amazing! It was sublime and I heartily recommend. Friends had a plentiful, delicious mixed tomato and mozzarella starter; both commented on the freshness and creaminess of the mozzarella.For mains, two of us had the freshly made beef burger with spinach and Gorgonzola on a brioche bun with hand cut chips. Another taste sensation and triumph! Our other friend selected he freshly made ravioli with a beef ragu which was again freshly prepared & exceedingly tasty. House red was a fine accompaniment for a lunchtime visit.We thoroughly enjoyed the whole ambience of the setting, the attentive and friendly service and the wonderful food - and our complimentary limoncello at the end topped it off perfectly.",

        "Review: Nearly missed the restaurant as I mistook it for a butchers! However, that was a good sign of things to come! A very unusual menu with things you don't normally see (bone marrow - delicious!) and even the \"run of the mill\" (tomato and mozzarella) was done with a twist - and the mozzarella was the creamiest ever. The staff were lovely and helpful and this place is really handy if your visiting Sadlers Wells. Would definitely recommend.",

Ecco questa \u00e8 esattamente la sensazione che ho provato in questo locale dal primo passo per andare al tavolo, fino all'ultimo per lasciare il locale. Strada suggestiva, locale ottimo, atmosfera perfetta. Ma due cose spiccano su tutto: il personale e i prodotti.PRODOTTI - Inutile girarci attorno, la qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 sempre la scelta migliore. Dagli affettati alla carne fino ai dolci tutto \u00e8 di altissimo livello e si vede l'impegno di tutti per fornire un esperienza culinaria ottima. Tutto \u00e8 fatto da loro dal pane alle salse alla pasta... tutto partendo dalle materie prime. E la carne? Un sapore unico si scioglie in bocca!!!! Esperienza pazzescaPERSONALE - Cuore. Questa \u00e8 la parola chiave, CUORE! Sono ragazzi che ci mettono impegno e dedizione, e si impegnano tutti per dare al cliente un servizio ottimo. Potrei nominare qualcuno ma sicuramente rischierei ingiustamente di lasciare fuori qualcuno, non sarebbe giusto perche davvero qui meritano tutti.PREZZO - so che per molti \u00e8 l'unica cosa importante ma mettiamola cosi: vuoi una serata dove niente sar\u00e0 fuori posto, con prodotti ottimi, e senza rimpianti? Il posto \u00e8 giusto e paghi il giusto per quello che scegli di mangiare. Non ti interessa di nulla e l'unica cosa che guardi \u00e8 il basso costo? Prendi la carne, il vino e gli affettati al supermercato e cucinateli a casa. Cos\u00ec risparmi anche il costo dei trasporti. In ogni caso la scelta rimane sempre tua... Ho scritto molto ma alla fine bastava una parola sola per questa recensione: GRAZIE!MIRKO",

        "Review: One of the first places I visited after lock-down was eased, and restaurants were allowed to open. On a Thursday night Exmouth market was lively as we sat at an outdoor table. The menu is basically steak based with only a few other options, but they do cook the steak very well, and the flavour of the meat speaks for itself. Service was friendly, the wine list is via QR code including a wide range of prices.",

Innanzitutto non ci \u00e8 stata neanche chiesta la cottura, ma va bene, essendo una fiorentina ci si aspetta che sia piuttosto al sangue. La bistecca era eccessivamente cotta e presentava una crosta molto dura e difficoltosa non solo da deglutire ma anche da masticare. La peggiore fiorentina della mia vita senza dubbio. Errore nostro nel voler mangiare una fiorentina fuori dall'Italia. Pagata anche a caro prezzo. ",

Meat hanging in fridges as decor is on brand but perhaps not to everyone's taste. Service throughout prompt enough but some delays and some misunderstandings on menu choice with little effort to remedy. Beer a little warm, plates a little small. These are small things but at \u00a37 per pint and high prices throughout these things can matter. Minimum number of grams required to be order certain steaks, taking the price very high even for London (unwelcome but perhaps for good reason in cooking). Would recommend to meat/steak lovers. Wouldn't recommend to anyone else.",

He then checked his diary and it turned out that we were given two hours and fifteen minutes. The host looked like he wasn\u2019t particularly happy when he found that out. Anyways, as the weather was nice we asked if we could be sat outside as there were free tables. The host then replied that they were all reserved, fair enough it was a Friday night and we understood. However, after 10-15 minutes nobody came and took those seats at the rear garden and some seats in front of the restaurant freed up too. Then my girlfriend asked one of the waiters if we could take the seats outside and we were told that it was ok. The host didn\u2019t look too happy. I said thank you to him too but got no reply. We stayed there for perhaps 30mins more but as we didn\u2019t feel welcome we left after starters. The \u201creserved\u201d tables never showed up and there were still empty tables outside and in the rear garden by the time we left. I guess the host didn\u2019t really like that I argued my 1:45min time slot in the beginning. He was rude and rather arrogant. It was my girlfriend\u2019s birthday so it was even more disappointing that we had to experience this. We moved to another restaurant down the street. On the plus side, food was lovely and our waiter was really polite and understanding that we wanted to switch tables.",

They were cheaper than we were told, which makes a pleasant change but we didn\u2019t take the second \u00a360 bottle and switched to a cheaper one because of the price when it was actually \u00a336!

        "Review: Visited yesterday, having booked a table in advance. On arrival, we were told that the table had been rebooked later in the evening, so that we would have to vacate within two hours. Not a good start! After being shown to our table, I requested an alcohol free beer as I was the designated driver with 120 mile journey home. I was frankly astonished to be told they don't stock any. This is unacceptable and irresponsible in today's world. I then ordered calves liver, but the waitress said this was not available (they should have told us this when the menus were brought out). I subsequently chose rump steak, which was incredibly tender and perfectly cooked. The cannellini beans were superb too, as was the dessert. However, the meat was served tiny slate square sitting on a rustic chunk of wood - can we have proper plates please? Also, for some inexpicable reason, the steak knives were jammed into the table, and left standing upright - a bizzarre and unnecessary gimmick.The biggest disappointment was the seating arrangements: I was positioned with my back to the central gangway, and despite pulling my chair in as far as possible, I was repeatedly shoved in the back every time one of the staff passed through the narrow gap. Only one of them had the courtesy to apologise.In summary, the food was great and not over-priced, but service felt rushed and the waiting staff inconsiderate and discourteous.",

        "Review: Went here for lunch based on menu but was pretty disappointed with what I got.The descriptions on the menu make out that it\u2019s a bit of a temple to tuna but tbh I think I\u2019ve cooked better tuna myself at home with fish that I got from Tescos.My seared tuna that I had was ok but really nothing special at all. The portion wasn\u2019t particularly generous either, definitely what I call on the smaller side. There wasn\u2019t any whole tuna out on display as the on line menu says for you to choose your piece but there was a lot of meat on display which I guess is why people go there. I think we were the only people in the restaurant not eating huge great hunks of grilled steak.The place itself is nice, the staff are friendly and it\u2019s not unreasonably price. If you like meat it\u2019s probably fantastic but I wouldn\u2019t make a special journey there just to have the tuna.",

This is a delusion as this should be their best pasta dis- tables x 2 tops are too close to each other so this makes you feel uncomfortable For the pasta they recovered by offering side dishes but we could not eat them as they arrived too late and we had a lot of food.

        "Review: Went for dinner. I would mostly consider the disappointment due to the inexperience of the waiting staff. It appears that they try too hard, making it all a bit awkward as it's not done smoothly. I may like a continuous advice if i see the experience and the knowledge there, otherwise i'd rather not. The wine ordering was very painful and confusing: this wine is in the list but we don't have it, this other one we only have enough for 2 glasses, this other one we don't have but let me check, actually yes we have it.....The starters were really good however they really took forever to arrive and we had to chase twice as everyone seemed unaware that we had been waiting forever. We got a free bread basket as an apology which was nice but honestly quite a little gesture.The meat ordering also not smooth. We were talked into ordering far more meat than necessary: started from one size, then suggested we have it a bit bigger which we said ok, in the end it arrived even bigger because \"it's cut on the moment\"....result: a very significant bill and lot of leftover meat. The meat was nice (i had better at southken but this one still was good). Frankly the meal itself was nice but the experience was indeed affected by all the above. We would give it another go but probably at a different location.",

        "Review: We all know Italy is famous in the world for being a country of food passionates. But it\u2019s not easy to find a place outside of Italy that tickles Italians\u2019 heart when it comes to food. In London this kind of place exists: Macellaio (The Butcher) concept of Roberto Costa. This is the first butcher in London who offers table services and a complete dining experience, recreating the atmosphere of a cosy and warm Italian trattoria. I went to the Exmouth Market branch, but there are 4 other branches in London in Fitzrovia, South Ken, Union street and others. The hanging beef thighs in exposition in the windows are a piece of art and will get you salivating immediately, making it almost impossible not to ask for a table when you pass by.The specialties of the house cover mountain and sea: meat and tuna. The meat comes rigorously from the Fassona breed from the valleys north of Genova, whereas the tuna is fished in the Sicilian sea. Everything is served fresh or dry aged in the contemporary sharing cicchetti style\u00a0meats, fresh mountain cheeses and artisan breads. We ordered all the flagship dishes of the house (all in pics attached):- the famous T-bone steak (\u201cfiorentina style), in the pic attached, butchered in front of us and served still bleeding. - the Tuna Tartare sculpted by Donatello in person. - the Bone Marrow, meat \u201call albese\u201d, served with oil, pomegranate and parsley.The wine list is simply extraordinary and shows big character. Highly recommended the red wines from the best regions: the Piedmont, with Nebbiolo, Barbaresco, Barolo and Tuscany with Montepulciano, Brunello and Chianti. In summer you can seat outside, in the heat of the chatty pedestrians street, with people walking up and down Exmouth market looking for a place like this.Not to miss also the other 4 branches, as each has its own specialty on top of tuna and meat: artisan pizza, focaccia from Liguria and other delights.Ideal for couples and big groups. Make sure you ring them in advance before turning up.",

When we first arrived with rumbling bellies our eyes were alight by the array of meat on display - I thought I was in for a good evening!We occupied the second table of the dinner service and once seated we were left to peruse the quirky menu (newspaper design).A gentleman who I believed to be the head waiter came to the table to give suggestions about the dishes and type of meat and weight we may require. Seeing as there are 5 in the group we decided to share a number of starters (which were all good) & following the waiters suggestion we decided to share a Steak.He brought over two beautiful cuts of T-bone Steak weighting 2.5kg - I personally have a huge appetite but even this was too much meat for me. For this amount it would have cost roughly \u00a3180... we requested some time to discuss options between the group and eventually decided that we would prefer 1kg of fillet, this was closer to the \u00a3100 mark - to which we requested from the head waiter.I'm not sure if this decision upset him but he went away to see whether this amount could be cut... that was the last input he had with our group. We weren't even asked how we would like the meat cooked!Fortunately the steaks ranged from rare to medium and all in all we were pleased with the mains we received and the accompanying sides (chips, mash, spinach & salad). It was disappointing that we had to ask for the dessert menu on two separate occasions and then to still not receive it - to me this screamed we were no longer welcomed guests, I asked for the bill and departed. The food was good, shame about the service - it would have been pleasant if asked if we were enjoying/enjoyed the food. Work to be done...",

Served our dinner just after my wife went to the toilet. Served washed out spinach. I ordered my steak rare, my wife medium rare. My wife\u2019s appeared rare and mine medium. The wine was great but advertised as a carafe but came as a half carafe. No one asked for feedback during or after our meal and then got really grumpy when I said I wasn\u2019t going to pay the service charge that had been automatically added to the bill. My wife at this point wanted to raise our concerns as feedback, and instead of looking to make amends, they replied we hope it\u2019s better next- that\u2019s never going to happen. ",

Service was fantastic, ambience and music a great success but... the rump steak advertised by the waitor for being \"up to\" 6 weeks aged was not as tender as it should be and delivered cut in pieces (looking quite smaller than the original piece and with no way of checking it, usually this is done in front of you). Great side dishes, some wonderful potato fries with skin. Smaller burrata and steak tartar portions than expected. We paid around 50 Pounds Stirling per person which for the dinner we had was too much.",

The cutlery arrives with a slightly theatrical stab of the steak knives into the table. The meat arrives cooked perfectly, already sliced and ready for a mega-meat-blow-out.What can I say?

The thin little girl was constantly asking us if we were ready and once we were she didn\u2019t even ask what we want, she just tell us to buy the two most expensive things on the menu. My girlfriend said she wants a fillet and she was like \u201cno, better if you not, take the Fiorentina\u201d. We were literally on the verge to stand up and leave. She was italian and we are italians so we know type of meat they are serving. Other bad thing they tried to bring the plates away before we finish. It was 8.30pm, restaurant was not full, no one was outside waiting, we explained we were not on a rush so we didn\u2019t really like this rush in the service and being pushy in overselling before even ask what we want. It\u2019s a shame because the quality of the food is amazing, portions are ridicolous for the prices, but the quality really worth it, the service not.",

Well, listen me carefully: Il Macellaio offers the best selection of Italian\u2019s meat, Italian food and Italian\u2019s hospitality. It is the best restaurant in town. The Fiorentina steak we had (along with appetizers, baked potatoes and a bottle of Chianti\u2019s wine) is the best treat you can have. The steak was delicious (Fiorentina is the t-bone by the way), smooth, delicious. The service was superbe, the staff is so friendly, warm and attentive. We were attended by Antonio and Claudia, two young, enthusiastic and professional guys who served us in a superbe way and who deserve our great feedback (anyhow the whole staff is very friendly and professional too).If you want to taste authentic Italian meat at the same way we cook and eat in Italy, please pay a visit to this fantastic restaurant which offers the highest quality standard of Italian cuisine in London. Please do not miss a dessert and some limoncello to end up your dinner. You will feel in heaven.

Do you want to pay \u00a345 for a steak, sitting in the back of a rough and ready caf\u00e9, and then be charged an extra \u00a35 for chips of quite poor quality? The steaks are priced by weight, and they tell you the weight but you have to do the maths yourself. It was exceptionally good steak, cooked perfectly but I've had as good cheaper in nicer surroundings... And then there's the toilets. The unisex toilets are dark, dank, and dirty. I was pleased to stand, ladies will choose to hover and my other half elected to hold on and wait. My advice is to check your wallet and the toilets before committing to a steak.",

The apple pie to finish was also very good. However, we had barely ordered our appetizers when they arrived. We hadn\u2019t even sipped the wine! Upon finishing our appetizers, the main arrived within 2-3 minutes!! This was a shame as after large appetizers you don\u2019t immediately wish to have your main so quickly.

        "Review: We'd previously visited Macellaio in Southwark for a Butchery Masterclass. The food was exceptional, but unfortunately some elements of the class setup didn't quite meet expectations. Knowing this, the team very kindly invited us back for a second chance and to restore our faith in what they can do.We decided to try a different location, as we were already keen to head to their site in Exmouth Market. It's a relaxed and informal setting, with a brilliant busy local vibe. Diego met us on arrival and took us to our table, and from there he led the evening - from choosing the best dishes for us, pairing it with some amazing Italian wines and explaining everything in front of us. He was a great host, even on a particularly busy evening, and it was beyond our expectations; we very much appreciated it. The food was as good as we remembered - with steak and tuna tartare to start, followed by a steak main with vegetables and spinach, and an incredible panna-cotta and a chocolate brownie to finish. It all tasted amazing, We left the restaurant and moved to their bar next door for one last night cap before heading off.The staff have always been incredibly friendly and very welcoming. We would definitely recommend visiting to give it a try! We'll be back again soon :)",

        "Review: This is an informal cafe style Italian restaurant with a busy local vibe. The staff were efficient and friendly offering helpful advice when required.The restaurant ages its own meat, which is served by weight. 400g per person was recommended to us (about right for 2 young men and an old fella) at \u00a36.20/100g. Cheaper options are available but I have no complaints about value for money, especially when compared to other high end steak houses in town. The meat was absolutely delicious, beautifully cooked and beautifully presented, among the very best I have had and certainly better than anything I have eaten in London.Sides are reasonably priced and very tasty. Desserts are refreshingly inexpensive (\u00a33 for a chocolate and orange truffle, \u00a35 for a Torta di Mele), so you will be tempted even after consuming your enormous steak. Wine is all Italian and offered at a variety of prices from about \u00a325 up to around a hundred. The Montepulcino at \u00a332 went very well with the steak.Tuna steaks are also available. I will definitely return, I strongly suggest you give it a go, even if you have to go out of your way. Unless you are a vegan.",

        "Review: We really enjoyed our dinner at Macellaio in Clerkenwell. We had noticed the restaurant when we had dinner at Moro recently. The meat is absolutely incredible. It is tasty, soft and melts in your mouth. Service is very nice : the Italian waiters are fun and efficient. There are a lot of choices on the wine list, very reasonably priced. We paid \u00a3155 for three, having shared a one kilogram T-bone, starters, deserts and wine. Very good in London for such a quality of food",

        "Title: Orgoglio italiano che rasenta la perfezione",
        "Review: Questa \u00e8 una di quelle recensioni che si \u00e8 contenti di fare.Arriviamo in questo ristorante quasi per caso e del tutto impreparati: eravamo a Londra da 3 giorni e dopo 2 passati tra panini e fastfood volevo regalarci una cena seduti, al caldo; chiaro che la scelta di Londra \u00e8 ampia ma \u00e8 pur sempre vero incontrare i gusti di un italiano \u00e8 impresa ardua.Dopo aver sfogliato mille e poi mille pagine web il mio compagno mi fa presente che un suo collega aveva nominato il \u201cMacellaio\u201d; a Londra ce ne sono 4 e optiamo per quello che con i mezzi poteva esserci pi\u00f9 comodo, quello in zona Clerkenwell.Sabato sera, non abbiamo prenotato, siamo sotto le festivit\u00e0 natalizie, sappiamo che stiamo tentando la sorte ma decidiamo di andare all'avventura.Arriviamo e veniamo accolti subito molto bene, ci spieghiamo in inglese finch\u00e9 non ho iniziato a tradurre al mio compagno ed \u00e8 emerso che potevamo parlare in italiano: oltre il nome anche lo staff \u00e8 completamente made in Italy.Triste notizia \u00e8 che sono pieni ma mi suggeriscono di poter aspettare nella stanza accanto, al bar, prendermi qualcosa e rimanere al caldo \u2026 ci pensiamo un po\u2019: di rimanere ad attendere in una stanza non mi andava, pochi giorni a Londra voglio sfruttare al massimo ogni momento, anche se il bar era una prospettiva attraente, cos\u00ec ci facciamo un giro arrivando a St. Paul; prima di uscire mi viene chiesto il numero di telefono e mezz\u2019ora dopo vengo chiamato per dirmi che il mio tavolo \u00e8 pronto. Fin da subito capiamo che il servizio sarebbe stato di alto livello.L\u2019ambiente \u00e8 particolare: unisce, se volete, i dettami classici della trattoria italiana ad un tocco di pub inglese, tutto fuso in modo estremamente elegante.Veniamo fatti accomodare da una ragazza simpatica ma anche gli altri membri dello staff, mentre passiamo, ci danno tutti la buonasera o anche un semplice \u201cciao!\u201d.Ci portano i menu,, anche questi sono di un rustico raffinato, quasi un ossimoro che per\u00f2 cattura l'attenzione e pensi \"per\u00f2, fighi questi menu\". Faccio opera di traduzione ma non essendo indigeno alcune parole ( esempio: noce moscata o la precisa zona del taglio del manzo) mi mancano; nessun problema, la signorina che ci segue traduce, spiega i tagli, suggerisce piatti tratti dalla tradizione italiana ma rielaborati da quelli che vi si attengano pedissequamente.Prendiamo due antipasti ( uno bresaola e stracchino, l\u2019altro crudo e grana) , molto buoni e ben serviti, la qualit\u00e0 dei prodotti \u00e8 italiana, ma da buon italiani ci manca qualcosa: il pane! Subito servito un cestino di pane che evidentemente era stato fatto fresco (unico appunto un po\u2019 salato) cos\u00ec come la focaccia e, dopo averlo chiesto esplicitamente, arrivava la conferma: tutto fatto da loro in cucina.Piatti principali: uno la bistecca, io il petto di manzo coi funghi, che, aiutato da una legislazione locale che permette una frollatura maggiore (anche questo spiegatoci direttamente dallo staff) poteva essere servito con un risultato maggiore in termini di morbidezza e gusto.Due piatti, magnifici! Contorno pur\u00e8 di patata (buono) e patate arrosto (ottime).Ad alta perfomance i dolci: oltre i dolci normali ve ne erano due molto particolari e di ispirazione italiana; la crema fritta \u2013 tipica di molte regioni \u2013 ed una sorta di panna cotta della quale non si pu\u00f2 svelare niente per non rovinare la sorpresa, elemento essenziale della portata.Oltre al cibo, che \u00e8 stato di alto livello, ancora pi\u00f9 di livello \u00e8 stato il personale, che unisce la professionalit\u00e0 alla sensazione di essere veramente a cena da amici. Occupandomi spesso di valutazione del personale ho osservato come si muovevano nell\u2019ambiente tutti gli appartenenti allo staff, come si rapportavano ai clienti, non lasciano trapelare alcuna scocciatura alle domande e richieste, spesso inappropriate e poco intelligenti, dei clienti, servono il cibo in modo simpatico e con un minimo di spettacolarit\u00e0 (dal far suonare i vassoi al fermarti con un coltello il conto), offrono molte spiegazioni, informazioni, oltre il cibo \u00e8 una visita guidata nella cultura agroalimentare dell\u2019Italia ma ripeto, tutto in simpatia.E' chiaro, inutile nasconderci, che il buon \"cameriere\" \u00e8 colui che non solo porta il piatto ma riesce a venderti quello che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 buono, magari il pi\u00f9 costoso o, alcune volte, quello che deve uscire dalla cucina; bene il personale potrebbe aver fatto tutto questo, guidandoci in una scelta delle portate opportunistica - il che significherebbe aver fatto bene il proprio lavoro - ma \u00e8 stato fatto con un'educazione, una simpatia e, sopratutto, una naturalezza dei rapporti che, vi garantisco \u00e8 andata ben oltre al conto, e l'ultimo piacevole saluto c'\u00e8 stato quando addirittura eravamo gi\u00e0 usciti dal locale.Gente, i membri del personale sono campioni naturali incrementati da un'ottima preparazione.Infine poter bere un caff\u00e8 italiano fatto da italiani a Londra \u00e8 stato come sentirsi \u201cin salvo\u201d dalla barbarie gastronomica inglese.Io sono rimasto colpito da Valeria, la ragazza che ci ha aiutato a scegliere \u2013 difficile definire tutto il personale \u201ccamerieri\u201d perch\u00e9 sono qualcosa di pi\u00f9 \u2013 e Walter che per un po\u2019 si \u00e8 seduto con noi cos\u00ec che potessimo continuare i discorsi iniziati poco prima.Il prezzo, \u00e8 giusto dirlo, non \u00e8 economico, ma perch\u00e9 economico non \u00e8 il cibo, non \u00e8 la cucina, non \u00e8 il servizio, non lo sono le materie prime \u2026 paghi per quello che mangi, paghi il trovarti in un posto di valore, paghi, in modo del tutto proporzionato, l\u2019esperienza che stai vivendo.Andare a Londra e lasciarsi sfuggire questo angolo di Italia \u00e8 come trovarsi a Firenze e non fermarsi in Piazza della Signoria: entrambe sono cosa ricorder\u00f2 delle rispettive citt\u00e0!Sono veramente entusiasta, e mi dispiacerebbe tornare \"a casa loro\" (perch\u00e8 ospiti graditi ci siamo sentiti) e non trovare la stessa atmosfera e la stessa qualit\u00e0 ... per questo spero di tornarci presto.",

        "Review: First of all, came here looking for a table of one and they welcomed me with open arms, gave me a choice of tables to sit on. Secondly, Christian (the waiter who looked after me) was on top of everything. He explained the menu very well and recommended I eat the tuna steak which was wonderful. He also came to check on me every now and then to make sure everything was ok. I'm partially deaf and it was slightly noisy in the restaurant so Christian came closer to me to speak in order that I heard everything which I really appreciated. I'm already planning my next visit here with some friends!!",

Nice touch was a little complement of some salami like meat. For the mains, some of us opted for two plates from the starters, others went for the actual main menu. Mine steak tartar was nice but a pit under seasoned, tuna bresaola was excellent though, couldn't help myself to share it with the whole table. The rump with rocket and parmigiano steaks that two of the party ordered looked nice but very chewy and fatty as people said. The rabbit was nicely cooked and flavoured and the baby chicken was good as well, poor meat to bone ratio was the only downside.All and all was a pleasant evening, apart from the fact we weren't getting much attention. Had to flag the staff after 20 minutes of sitting down to take our order, which was quite frustrating since the place wasn't even that busy. Took as much to get the bill as well.",

Taking us through to the restaurant area and seating us at a spacious table.A quick but very comprehensive resume of the menus and we were soon eating our way through some delicious starters and looking forward to our main courses which were going to be shared rib eye steak (with bone) and tuna.When the main dishes arrived we were most impressed, the beef was cooked just as we had asked, rare and was very tender and full of flavour.The tuna, again served rare as we asked was also excellent.The meal was accompanied by a good bottle of wine.Our bill was presented when we asked and our only issue was of our own making in that we had to rush off to the theatre.Will definitely go back when we are not going to the theatre!",

The sides, I have to admit, are very overpriced and not great for what they are. From starters, I enjoyed the carpaccio and burrata.

Have to say we nearly missed Macellaio, having walked past it once thinking it was a closed butchers shop. On second passing we cautiously entered and asked for a table. The restaurant was very busy, but the manager managed to squeeze us in. I loved the newspaper style menu. Seeing that beef was a speciality, I chose steak tartare to start,followed by a tagliata rump steak cooked rare. My wife had buratta followed by a medium tagliata. My steak tartare was perfect and the tagliata beautifully cooked exactly as ordered. My wife commented that her beef was probably the best she'd had for some years - and she loves her steak! We eat out a lot and cook well at home and Macellaio was one of the most enjoyable experiences we've had for a long time. I mustn't forget the staff who were very friendly and attentive, particularly our waiter who took some time explaining the menu and the cuts of meat. All in all a great evening - thank you Macellaio. We'll be back. ",

Generally we eat in places which make us feel good and Macellaio certainly does this. A butcher's shop at the front and a very cool restaurant at the back. Predominantly red and white with great graphic touches , the decoration is very well considered and puts one in the mood from the off. In addition the young staff are charming and friendly without being unprofessional. The wine list is full of decent vintages and i ordered a good bottle of Amarone which at \u00a394 was one of the priciest but by the end of the last glass seemed eminently worth it. The menu generally comprises small dishes . Everything we ate was tasty but variably seasoned. Either far too much or too little. We also shared a rib eye of their dry aged Italian beef. Although i was really in the mood it didnt measure up to Waitrose organic Scottish meat by a long chalk and i am beginning to wonder on the merits of dry aging anyway. I mean who cares. It would have been tender anyway and i just dont know if the real flavour hadnt evaporated during that month on a hook. Regardless this is a very good , enjoyable evening out and i came away feeling i would like to return soon. I think it would also make a great place for a small party. Coffee is also excellent!!!! On a par with Frescobaldi. ",

        "Review: We were lured by the amazing appearance of the meat cellar which you can see while walking along the street of Exmouth Market. My friend and I are both meat lovers so we didn't think twice. We entered and a young lad showed us a nice bit of \"costata\", which in English should translate to ribeye steak. The marbling looked amazing so we decided to go for that one, rather than the posher \"fiorentina\".To start we ordered some steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. The waiter asked us if we wanted the tartare with anchovies and other condiments, we said yes, but the tartare came as a plain one. No bread provided with it, which should be, and we had to ask for it. The tuna carpaccio consisted of 3 slices of uber-seasoned fish (lots of pepper, salt and some fine herbs), otherwise tasteless, and not great in aspect either. The steak came and it was served on a black dish (I believe it was cast iron). The temperature of the dish was mild at best, and in fact the steak went cold really quickly. There was a latent, subtle after taste of fridge to it, and it wasn't as tender as we expected.The side dishes of chips and roasted potatoes were nothing special and in hindsight (after seeing the bill) the price was extortionate too, given the size of their portions.Overall, we were not happy with the service either: we had to wait ages between courses, more than anything acceptable within the whole idea of slow-food; no one came to ask us whether we wanted more drinks (which should be the number 1 thing any good-selling waiter should do..we could have probably spent 3 times as much on beer); and we had to wait ages even to get the 2 coffees that were kindly offered by the house, which we ended up drinking on our way out as we couldn't wait any longer.On our way out we also took a quick look at the meat counter and saw that the bit of beef the lad showed us, to explain what cut we were going to get, was still there. If the beef cut looked untouched, then, I guess, the conclusion is that the steak we were served came from somewhere else, which I find a bit \"debatable\", shall we say.I am really disappointed by the experience. I thought I could taste the flavours of my home again, for one night, without having to catch a flight. I hoped I'd found a must-come-back place, but the truth is that I will not be giving them my money ever again.",

        "Review: I went in to this restaurant with a colleague having been turned away by an Italian restaurant just up the road. What a stroke of luck!This place specialises in Italian tuna and Italian steaks. The menus works on small plates to start, all traditional Italian foods, then a selection of steaks or tuna dishes. There is a small selection of what they call \"Poor Dishes\" at the back of the menu which are traditional Italian peasant dishes if you don't fancy steak.However, we fancied steak. So, we chose three small plates to share as a starter and then ordered a ribeye steak to share for our main course.The starters were great but the steak was truly spectacular! I've eaten steak all over the world and this has to be up there with the best of them. It was tender, beautifully cooked and had an absolutely amazing flavour.Add to this, great service and a really good red wine and you've got the perfect night out.Can't recommend this place highly enough.",

        "Title: Mostly excellent, but some faults - 3.5/5",
        "Review: I visited twice before reviewing, once as a couple, and one as a group of four.FoodFirst off, the more people you have the better, as this is very much a sharing restaurant. The food is generally excellent. We tried several off the starters. Particular favourites were the tuna carpaccio and the beef bresaola. We loved being able to eat the tuna and beef together and we're stunned at how similar they tasted. The battuta was also very well prepared, and melts in your mouth. We also had a mixed seared beef/tuna plate. I didn't love the sauces that came with this, but it got demolished by the table. One complaint would be that the starters (and sides) are very small - probably no more than 4/5 mouthfuls each. For a sharing concept restaurant it would be great if they could devise a taster plate which gives you a mouthful of more than starter. This would be much easier than divvying up starters between four people. For our main we had the t bone steak - perfectly cooked medium rare, and accompanied by very good wine (about \u00a330 for a bottle). On our first visit we had chips (not great), and changed to roast potatoes (great!) on the second visit. The green vegetables are all well cooked and seasoned - no complaints here. Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate cake and the cheese cake. The cheese cake was not a winner across the table (too sweet, and the base too soft), but the chocolate cake got a universal thumbs up... so much so that we ordered another to share!Overall, I'd go back, but it would be good to see the starters in a form that is a bit more easily shared. ServiceWe were left with a bad impression, as we needed to send back our second order of chocolate cake back twice to be heated through, and it felt like a fuss. However, service was otherwise very good - the waiter was helpful in explaining the concept, suggesting a range of meat/fish and matching the wine to what we had ordered. PriceOn our first visit we paid \u00a377 for two, and on the next visit \u00a3196 for four. On each occasion we had three courses and wine. I'd say that the side orders are a bit on the stingy side - probably 1 1/2 portions per item, and you'd hope to be able to share between at least two people. Overall we thought the price was fair - but towards the upper end of what we'd be happy to spend on this meal. 12.5% service is added to your bill - something I prefer to choose myself. Budget \u00a340-50 per person including wine.OverallFood - 4/5Service - 3.5/5Price - 3/5Total - 3.5/5",

        "Review: This is not your regular Italian restaurant. You can forget your regular pizza and pasta dishes, this place is a cut above the rest (the pun is very much intended). i was initially drawn by the shop front as I wanted to have a look at what appeared to be a very traditional, old fashioned butchers shop. I was not disappointed as this is exactly what it is with the addition of the fishmonger next door. With the look and feel of early twentieth century, the service complimented the style too. Friendly, efficient and knowledgable staff helped us with our choice of wine and matching it to our food choice. The butcher preps your meet at the front of the shop before it is presented and cooked to your taste. Before the food arrives our steak knives are stabbed into the work oak tables at which you sit. The meat is special, cooked properly, served properly and melts in the mouth. we cannot wait to go back and spend more time here.",

        "Review: What is wrong with this place? It specialises in steak and tuna. You'd expect both to be knockout especially as the prices they're charging are high. The starters we had were very good in all fairness despite one of them not arriving until just before the first course arrived. However, the mains were a cynical manoeuvre in \"talk up the goods and they will believe they are good\". T-bone steak was chewy and full of fat. Tuna main course was stinky, chewy and generally old to ancient. We should have known the cynical nature of the business when the side salad arrived without any dressing (no olive oil etc on the table) and looking at least a day old. In summary, save your money and go somewhere else. ",

        "Review: In quattro giorni di soggiorno a Londra, ho avuto il piacere di pranzare e cenare nei tre Ristoranti \"Il Macellaio RC\" di Roberto Costa. In tutti tre i locali io e la mia famiglia siamo rimasti letteralmente impressionati dalla bont\u00e0 e dalla genuinit\u00e0 dei cibi serviti da personale competente, disponibile, affabile e sempre pronto ad accertarsi che tutto fosse di nostro gradimento, mettendoci al corrente, ad ogni portata, della provenienza e della preparazione di ci\u00f2 che ci accingevamo a mangiare e bere. Il locale in 38-40, Exmouth Market \u00e8 accogliente e dall\u2019atmosfera rilassante. Ci siamo sentiti molto a nostro agio. Tipici e dal sapore unico e caratteristico gli antipasti: carpaccio di tonno (eccezionale); le battute di carne cruda al Gorgonzola e all\u2019Albese (ottime); la Fassona tonnata (veramente speciale). Una curiosit\u00e0 ci ha spinto ad ordinare poi un\u2019Amatriciana al guanciale e tonno: veramente buona e particolare. Abbiamo continuato con una eccellente bistecca di tonno con patate, arrosto e spinaci (insuperabili) ed un\u2019Orecchia di elefante panata, altra ottima specialit\u00e0. Gustare sapori nuovi e contemporaneamente genuini \u00e8 il top! Il tutto accompagnato da una vasta scelta di vini sapientemente suggeriti dal personale ed adatti ai cibi consumati. Per finire mix di dolci: latte dolce fritto e il delicatissimo ed unico \u201cbianco al basilico\u201d. Complimenti vivissimi al titolare Roberto Costa che abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere e di renderci conto che \u00e8 veramente una persona semplice ed unica sia nel rapporto con la clientela che col personale: secondo me \u00e8 il datore di lavoro che tutti vorrebbero! Abbiamo visto anche la trasmissione di Alessandro Borghese \u201c4 Ristoranti\u201d e siamo pienamente d\u2019accordo che \u201cIl Macellaio RC\u201d di Roberto Costa sia risultato il miglior ristorante Italiano a Londra: la sua competenza in materia e il suo gesto finale non fanno che avvalorare la mia stima nei suoi riguardi.

        "Review: Cosy restaurant on a cold night. Service was charming and friendly. Steak very well-flavoured and cooked exactly as requested. Chips very good. Other side dishes all good if a little small. Only criticism is that there are a few too many gimmicks, such as sticking the knives in the table and serving food on slates (I'd really thought London restaurants were over that). Not cheap but good, so we will be back- we want to try some of the cucina poverty options",

I opted for the pasta with beef ragu for my main but it was slightly disappointing. I thought with the emphasis on the meat, that it would be outstanding and meaty but it was bang average. The rib eye my boyfriend had on the other hand was outstanding! Could be one of the best steaks I have had in London! Cooked perfectly! He had a side of broccoli too which although rather small was extremely tasty. Generally a great experience, we'll go back and I'm definitely getting the steak!",

        "Review: Part of me doesn't want to write a review for this place in case it becomes any more popular! I honestly can say I had one of the best meals of my life here. The concept is simple: that tuna and steak can both be prepared in the same way. Starters are tuna or beef carpaccio or tartare and mains are steaks...tuna steak or beef steak. We (two of us) had the tuna and beef tartares to start with and then the beef steak for main. Both tartares were delicious. I'm a bit of a steak fiend and the steak...beautiful. So full of flavour and perfectly cooked. And because the meal was just delightful I was sure we wouldn't be disappointed by the basil panacotta. I was right - it was the perfect way to end such a delicious meal. We went as a couple on a Friday night and were seated without having to book a table. It was at the end of summer so the outside tables were all taken up but the inside has a lovely rustic ambience and was lovely too. For two of us I think the meal and a bottle of wine was less than \u00a3100 which I'd be more than willing to pay over and over and over again - I was in food heaven.",

Meno rilassato il personale, in giacca e cravatta che recita una noiosa cantilena riguardante la loro proposta degustativa, va benissimo.Anche i prezzi sono in giacca e cravatta, per cui le aspettative crescono, il che va bene.Siamo in 4, prendiamo 4 antipasti da condividere, ci viene suggerito di fare mix and match cosi da assaggiare tutto ma le porzioni sono da nouvelle cuisine. Carpaccio e entrecote di tonno squisiti, una antipasto con agnello (che io non avrei scelto, gusto personale) e un vasetto con forse salsa tonnata (non l'ho scelto io e non ho capito bene cosa fosse). Risultato antipasti, due ottimi e due mediocri che quindi si annullano.Carne, ci viene consigliata bistecca da 1,2 Kg essendo in 4, ci viene presentato il pezzo e noi accettiamo. Qualita della carne buona, cottura, temperature servita, buona.Finale il dolce: preso una crema di basilica che, personalmente, ho trovato un po stuccante, tiramisu presentato in un vasetto perche' probabilmente non avrebbe avuto nulla altro di speciale.Conclusione, antipasto non convincente, carne ok, dolce deludente e, se c'e' una cosa che odia il cliente, e' mangiare un dolce che non sia secondo le aspettative, e' l'ultima cosa che rimane impressa del locale.P.S.Era un sabato, probabilmente provero' Il Macellaio a South Kensington.Comunque rimane un parere personale condiviso con i miei commensali.Aggiungo che, una volta seduti al tavolo, viene offerta una bresaola che e' squisita.",

This time I also tried the tuna stake and it is amazing! Great service, the staff is very welcoming, professional and fast",

        "Review: The beef and tuna on offer here are excellent quality which allows them to be served very rare. The absence of lots of dressing or sauces means the taste of the beef and tuna is mouth-watering. The wine we had was very smooth and the grappa of excellent quality. I was a guest so not sure about the price. Service was very helpful and provided good advice. The best steak I've has in London and probably cheaper than most.",

        "Review: I went here this evening after walking along Exmouth Market while staying at the nearby Holiday Inn. I wish I hadn't bothered. Over \u00a360 for 1 person for a starter, main course and a small glass of red wine. The starter was a tiny piece of tough lamb. I gave feedback to the waiter as he removed my plate and the answer was \"ok\", nothing more. For main I had the steak. To be fair it was a very good piece of meat, well seasoned and cooked rare. The problem was that it was served on a freezing cold skillet and was cold itself (again the waiter came over, put his fingers on the skillet to confirm what I told him and then left). The meat was served with side dishes of spinach and roast potatoes with herbs, actually undercooked deep fried potatoes with no herbs anywhere to be seen. All in all a really poor meal. At some \u00a361 then I would rate it as without doubt the poorest value meal I have had in a very long time.",

The ageing beef in the cold room by the entrance looked wonderful. starters of beef carpaccio and steak tartare were spot on and then we shared a 400g ribeye which tasted as good as it looked. the knives were sharp too! See the photos. All accompanied by a recommended Montepulciano. Plenty of tap water - no charge - was replenished without asking several times. Cannot recommend the experience enough and for fellow northerns it is only a 5 minute cab from Kings Cross!For me a real 19/20, superb and thoroughly recommended!",

Quarti di carne disposta sul bancone il cui colore rappresenta gi\u00e0 una garanzia. Io ho mangiato, nelle due sere in cui sono stato, solo carne; pare tuttavia consigliato anche il tonno rosso proveniente dal mediterraneo. Giudizio assolutamente positivo sia sulle portate che sul servizio. Un encomio particolare a federico che, essendo da solo seduto al bancone del bar, mi ha tenuto \"compagnia\" nel corso della serata scambiando due parole e facendomi, altres\u00ec, scoprire un'etichetta di greco di tufo tra le migliori mai provate.

So the restaurant was quiet but we really liked it. There is a superb wine list and we chose to eat 'tapas' style small dishes. We chose steak tartare, tuna carpaccio (both delicious), oxtail vaccinara, tuna ceviche, then tagliata with chips and cannelloni beans. There was more than enough tasty food and we were too full for dessert. All the staff were friendly and attentive and we were given a digestif before leaving for home. All in all a very pleasant experience and we would return. ",

        "Review: It was my birthday recently and we were recommended this restaurant by a colleague of mine at work. As a big fan of Italian cuisine and wine, I had high hopes for this place and boy did they deliver.It wasn't too busy as it was a Wednesday night, but with a lovely relaxed ambience. We were shown to our table by the friendly waitress who explained the concept behind the restaurant and how much to order for the two of us. Then she sent over the sommelier who was very good as he listened to my preferences and then recommended a bottle accordingly. We went for a bottle of Amarone and it was very good.The waitress was spot on with regards to how much to order, between two of us we had three starters, steak for main and three sides, it was the perfect mount, full but not stuffed indeed we had room for dessert.I appreciate people have different tastes but the level of quality here really is something. The beef was like butter even though we had ours served rare and the starters were all amazing (try everything).As a nice finish to the evening we got to meet the owner as he was dining in the restaurant and thanked him for a wonderful meal, he even offered us some complimentary limoncello to finish off a lovely evening.I would highly recommend this restaurant and I am sure we will be back soon!",

The restaurant is relatively small but very comfortable with an air conditioner which really helps during warm summer nights. The owners were very friendly, attentive, and they know their business in depth. A butcher stands by the counter preparing the orders. There was a cue for diners without reservations (luckily we reserved), and some were refused as they were fully booked.We tried the aged ribeye steak and it was amazing - melts in the mouth, the flavour was deep and rich. Pricey but worth every penny. It is comparable to kobe beef, but flavour-wise is still a notch up.Highly recommended, you must try it.",

Every restaurant aims to offer an \"experience\".This restaurant wants to introduce the high quality of their products and to propose a path between fassona meat and wild yellowfin tuna, which are treated and cooked in similar ways.So let Simone, Eugenio and Emilio give you some advice, choose a nice bottle of red wine from their excellent wine list and let yourself be carried away by the marvellous service and the countless shades of red...",

        "Review: I had reasonable expectations about this Italian steakhouse with the ambitious goal of providing also tuna dishes as an alternative to raw beef or standard \"tagliata\".Prices are much more affordable than the Chelsea branch but they reflect the relatively small portions (tapas-like) they provide. With 25 pounds you will be able to have a 2 course with soft drink and service and it's great value for a steakhouse.Unfortunately there were moments where attention to detail was not at the right standard: the trenette al pesto totally lacked salt (they probably forgot to put in the boiling water) and potatoes bites were raw (whereas they should be slightly boiled). The overall dish was badly affected and the maitre was very apologetic and I appreciated I wasn't charged for it.The tagliata \"nuda\" (garnished with olive oil) was cooked rare rather than medium-rare and I recall I wasn't asked how I preferred to be cooked when I had ordered it. Eventually I didn't complain as the quality of the meat was very good. As said above, for \u00a38 you can't expect more than half a steak so I'd recommend ordering another type of tagliata or a special not to stay hungry...On the contrary, the \"dolce latte fritto\" as a dessert was a great find! Creamy and with a hint of chocolate sauce is a must to finish your meal.I have to say I was a little hungry when I left so this restaurant might be more suitable for brunch rather than a full meal...Service was quite friendly and the maitre (or owner?) seemed very passionate about their business, that's a good sign..I am afraid it was an unlucky occasion (still pretty odd because I didn't go in a very busy time) but the potential is clear and the business seems solid as they will open a third restaurant in Southwark soon.",

        "Review: Such a shame that I have to write this review, but do beware if you dine here.The decor is gorgeous, the food delicious and the staff are on the main very good.I haven't written to the restaurant to complain before writing this review as the manager on duty was disappointing and uninterested in our complaint.My friend ordered a nice bottle of wine to have with our meal. Once it arrived he noticed it didn't taste the same as he thought it should. He checked the bottle and couldn't see the name of the wine anywhere on the label [Brunello]. He asked the manager if it was the correct bottle and he confirmed it was.He tried the wine again, and asked the manager again- he said it was the right bottle with some irritation.in the meantime, my girlfriend asked a waiter who said he would check and never came back.I Googled the label and then queried the manager a third time and he said he was absolutely sure so I asked him if he would go and check. He came back and this time admitted that it wasn't the right wine 'but it costs the same so don't worry'. I mentioned this wasn't good enough so he brought the wine we originally ordered and said he wouldn't charge for the original bottle after some prompting. Shame as we had finished our meal and it was the perfect wine for what we ordered.Bringing the wrong bottle [and saying the name of what we ordered] is a bad mistake, but after querying three times it just smacks of being lied to [whether to cover up the original mistake or not, it's so disappointing], and being lied to three times is just not on.I had to ask to take the service charge off [his service not the others was awful]. So, we had a cheaper bill but it ruined the meal out.Good food, but not worth the hassle of being lied to. Avoid until the address this. You can't relax there if you have to check everything that comes out.",

        "Review: This is a delightful restaurant in a delightful setting. We have been bemoaning Kings cross as an area for so long and then by accident came across Exmouth Market which is a collection of lovely little cafes and restaurants. This one has a few tables out the front and also a small decked area out the back, which is great for a warm London summer. They clearly know what they are doing with beef and tuna which dominate the menu, along with an extensive wine list from independent producers for different steak done-ness. The food really blew us away - especially the smaller dishes actually, such as the carpaccio, battuta and stracciatella (heart of mozzarella with tuna roe - sounds odd but was perhaps the best dish). The guy running the place was genuinely interested in making recommendations and checking things were ok. The only surprising thing for me was that the beer choice was limited - mainly 3 German options which I didn't understand. But maybe I am a heathen?!I would love to go back, and with more people I would share the ribs (which is a minimum order of something like 500g). ",

Best steak we've had in a long time and the very friendly, helpful staff provided complimentary delicious tasters for us to try - the steak tartare literally melts in the mouth and is packed full of flavour and the tuna cheviche is also something else, it really is. The carefully selected wine list caters for all pockets and tastes and the Manager is only too pleased to discuss the wines with you - its so nice to see he has a real passion and enthusiasm for his wines and the food he produces. Nothing is too much trouble and we will definitely be returning. [To add a note, I do not agree with a previous review that the food is overpriced..... it is completely fair and reasonable given the quality of the produce... you can go to a local gastro pub and pay the same prices.... I would pay just to receive the service we were met with and staff that actually knew and cared about the food they were serving and the regions the wines came from.]",

        "Review: Macellaio specialises in Piedmont's fassone cattle, and tuna (\"the steak of the sea\"). So it's strictly for carnivores. It also dispenses with Michelin-impressing flummery - tablecloths, napkins, obsequious service. The vibe is free-and-easy; the service attentive but informal, and with attitude - your steak knife is jabbed into the table in front of you, rather than laid by in place. The food: chichetti - Italian tapas - were delicious, especially beef tongue with parsley salsa, and bottarga & stracciatella. After several meat-free weeks, I was ready for the steak, and it did not disappoint. Fassona beef is mature, dry-aged for 5 weeks, and our sirloin was crusty on the outside, rare on the inside, quite lean, but full of flavour - yielding but still with a good meaty heft. Pretty perfect in fact. Desserts were very good as well. There's a good and long, quite pricy wine list, specialising (of course) in Italian wines. But beef's the USP, and it lives up to the hype. Go there, tuck in. But vegetarians beware. The three of us paid about \u00a3170 - for three courses plus wine: that's pretty good value for very good food in Central London. We'll be back for more.",

We have been welcomed by Eugenio that took extreme care of us for the whole evening.At the Macellaio, they only serve Bluefin tuna from Sicily and Fassona beef, a breeding of Piedmontese cows traditionally known for the extreme tenderness and high quality of the meet.The combination beef and tuna might seems weird at the beginning, but Eugenio explained us that actually tuna and beef have quite a lot in common. In fact the tuna is the only fish warm blooded that can be cut in exactly 4 parts like a beef.We were sitting next to the butcher, Francesco, which was cutting and preparing our meat.We started our dinner with bollito croquettes with chocolate and sweet peppers sauce, the beef tartare and the tuna tartare with gorgonzola. Both meet and tuna were so soft that they melted on our mouths, absolutely extraordinary!As a main, we shared the 400 gr sirloin (it was pure perfection) with sides of roast potatoes and grilled vegetables. The steak was charred on the outside and rare inside, absolutely fabulous! The wine list, I would say way above the London average. We concluded our dinner with the basil pannacotta that totally blew our minds!The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, I felt like being back at home in Italy.The whole dinner exceeded our expectations. Now we can\u2019t wait to go back!Grazie for the special dinner ed a presto!",

        "Review: I booked a table at 9.15pm because an Italian friend came to London and I head great things about this restaurant. As we arrived a few minutes earlier and the table wasn't quite ready yet, the host suggested us to have a drink in their little outside area. We thought that was a great idea. After 9.45 we realized we were still outside and that the host never came to call us. I went inside to ask for our table and she said the table was ready ages ago and apologized about forgetting us outside. Once we were at the table and chose what we wanted we had to wait another 15 min to catch our waiter's attention. He seemed busy but he should at least have brought some water for the table or ask for drinks within 15min. Our experience was just getting worse and worse. We finally managed to order drinks and wine. The wine list was great and the wine we picked was delicious. We had a steak tartare to start and was very lovely but when our steaks came to the table, two of them were undercooked. We ordered them Med-Rare and they were absolutely rare if not even blue, also very chewy. We mentioned to the bar manager who saw us quite unhappy at the time and asked what happened. We explained and he apologized for the inconvenience but didn't do anything about it (offer to recook it for us or any sort os gesture). I felt terrible to take my friend there and have a not very nice experience. We paid for the bill and left very disappointed. Unfortunately not sure I'm ever coming again!",

        "Review: I went here for lunch. I had high expectations, but was disappointed to realize that the menu consists of essentially just 2 things: Beef and tuna. You can order different tartares and cuts, but there's not much variety to what they offer.I was also disappointed that the non-tuna/beef options (grilled veg, pasta) were somewhat of an afterthought. The grilled veg were not grilled (more marinated and served cold and oily). I had hoped for a selection of meats and sides, but that really isn't what this restaurant is about. It's just all about the tuna and meat.Also, note that the menu is not very clear about what items are. Tartares are very small- ramekin-sized- and we were told they were \"mains\" sized. Some of us went a bit hungry.I won't return, unfortunately.",

        "Review: We had high expectations of this restaurant after reading the reviews. While we liked it, there were a few niggles. The first was being crammed in on a tiny table right up against the wall. There was hardly any room for the large plates the food was served on, and we had to use the table next to us to fit everything on. That was OK until that table was occupied and then it all became an annoying juggling act. The starters were nice but very small - we ordered a lamb dish to share which was just two mouthfuls in size. Expensive per bite! The tuna and beef starter plate was OK but the tuna wasn't anything special. The main course of steak was good - the meat was tasty and cooked well, although a little chewy. The side dishes were very small - we had three to share. They were all overpriced for what they delivered. All in all our meal was OK but on balance, we found the meal was expensive for what it was. The food was pleasant but definitely not very memorable. Would we go back? Probably not.",

        "Review: We both ordered the tuna tartare to start and beef sirloin as a main course. You can perfectly taste the freshness of the tuna here, however it was a bit overpowered by too much added salt. Was a bit dismayed that they did not have the habit of asking how you would like the tartare prepared as it also might have been slightly too spiced for many tastebuds. Presentation was clean and simple. All you need! You are shown the hand cut steaks before they head off into the kitchen which is a nice touch. Even better is that the butcher is in the same room as you dine and cuts it right in front of you! Another nice touch is as they gave us our steak knives the waitress stabbed it into the table! How fun! Definitely no kids around here though! Sirloin was really perfect and tenderised by their in-house ageing. One of the best I've had in a while in London!The only thing that made the experience slightly disappointing is the service. As we were in more of a side room there was never really a member of staff in the room, only when they would take orders and serve. We had to help ourselves to salt and pepper and wait a while to order more drinks.Overall great dining experience and will come back for the food!",

        "Review: There\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t often go for dinner at my butchers and this place reminded me why. The place seemed nice when we walked in but we were led to a small side room which smelled overpoweringly of meat. The room itself was nicely decorated but the smell was quite off-putting and the clickety-clack sound of the order machine going off every minute wasn\u2019t great. Having not been there before we went with their recommendations for starters - tuna tartare and meatballs. The tuna was ok but unremarkable. The meat balls came on a small plate with sweet potato sauce. They were, apparently, seasoned with chocolate which sounded interesting but were just quite dry, lacking in flavour and there wasn\u2019t much enough sauce. We were considering our options at this point, a \u00a322 200g steak which seems quite high soncidering the quality so far so went with the \u00a316 surf & turf (seared tuna & seared steak on horseradish). Small portions (as warned - 90g each) but also cold (so not recently seared). On this evidence we left for a main course of fish and chips up the road. I understand the economics of running a restaurant are hard but this place just didn\u2019t hit the mark for us. The smell in the side room was off-putting and the food wasn\u2019t interesting or solid enough for somewhere that just focuses on tuna and steak.",

        "Review: My friend booked Macellaio for a group of us after hearing good things. Exmouth Market is one of my favourite little pockets of London, so I was happy to go along. It was a lovely hot day, so we sat outside (there were also electric heaters) and enjoyed the start of summer. The wine list was exceptional, the waitress was happy to help us choose a bottle of red and talk us through the rest of the menu. Basically: tuna or steak kind of tapas style so you can all dig in and sample different bits which I always enjoy. The beef was really tender and I enjoyed the selection of pairings it came with, such as gorgonzola and walnut or pear. So yummy. I don't think we were really adventurous in what we ordered, so I'm keen to go back and sample some of the goodies I saw being served to different tables. Quick round-up: something different, quality produce (it comes from a special farm in Italy), reasonably priced, good wine, fab service and nice atmosphere. Also, if you're friends with any pescetarians who love tuna, it's a perfect compromise. ",

        "Review: A very casual setting - a warm greeting from our waitress - a small newspaper for a menu. A good start. Think tapas. Think sharing. Think steak. Think tuna. The three of us shared beef tartare , smoked tuna slivers and beef tongue to start. Melting is the word that comes to mind. The tartare was soft and sharp either capers. The tuna dissolved in the mouth in smoky goodness, offset by the sharp bitterness of rocket. The tongue - so rarely seen these days - was soft and packed with flavour. A good start indeed! For mains we shared a 600g beef steak and a 250g tuna steak, with sides of roast potatoes, broccoli and green beans. A revelation. The steak was almost charred on the outside, rare either, studded either salt crystals - packed with flavour. The tuna much the same. And the potatoes deserve a mention - tiny, crisp, fluffy - flavour all the way. The desserts matched the rest of the meal - good to look at, better to eat. A good selection of wines at reasonable prices - and friendly informal and informational service. Highly recommended. ",

        "Review: The experience at Macellaio starts with getting a good table..as some appear rather \"close quarters\". We managed to change to a better one than offered while still early evening before it got too busy.Onto the eats. The beef dishes are just superp. ..we had the wafer thin beef carpaccio ..melt in mouth to die for ....and a 400g sirloin main..which was quality aged ..cooked to perfection..with the subtle crunchy salt a perfect compliment in both.The 500ml wine (asked for their recommendation)..was a smooth, if pricey, medium bodied Italian red...and worked v well with the food. An average veg side complimented.NOW..in our opinion the tuna starter and main, did not match up to the quality of the beef in taste..both tuna dishes we had were rather average but i wondered if this is because tuna has a more subtle taste and when you start mixing the dishes..pallet confusion! In my opinion the tuna may need more inventive culinary treatment to stand its ground....for example..cook with garlic, chilli., pepper...and possibly some overlay of veg would have helped..perhaps asparagus or spinach ? ....otherwise perhaps advice might be stick to one or the other. After loosing the battle with my companion to have the cheesecake, we ended up with a very average small pastry tart...which need not have been as small. On balance this was quality food experience with attentive helpful staff. Expect to pay a premium price ..near or into a 3 figure sum for 2, which in part can be justified by product quality and location. However in my opinion only the beef truly justified the high markup.

We sat down and started off ordering a bottle of wine with 2 sharing plates. A manager came by and asked us to leave the table and sit outside the garden.... It was bloody cold and raining. The reason was because they had another group of 4, whom haven't booked, and were wanting to dine in. I couldn't believe how cruel they treated us - reason being is that we only ordered 1 wine and 2 sharing plates.

Personale gentile e sorridente.Ho apprezzato le vetrine del Ristorante, dove su una c'era esposta un tonno e l'altra le mezzene, che teoricamente dovrebbero essere le celle frigorifere stesse.Abbiamo condiviso alcuni cicchetti misti fra manzo e tonno (tartare, tagliata di tonno e Tagliata di manzo).Premetto che non ho MAI mangiato una tartare o carne cruda, perci\u00f3 non avevo idea se potesse piacermi o meno.beh...ora che le ho assaggiate, le ADORO!La carne di manzo e tonno sono di qualit\u00e1 e freschissima! inoltre, all'occhio hanno quasi lo stesso colore (dettaglio importantissimo che conferma la freschezza del prodotto)!abbiamo avuto modo di provare la tartare di tonno e manzo al naturale, condite solo con sale pepe e olio, e credetemi erano Sublimi! Provate anche la beef tartare con il gorgonzola (per chi piacciono i gusti pi\u00fa decisi)...mmmmmmmmmm che bont\u00e1! :PPoi la tagliata di tonno con fragole e aceto balsamico...lo so, lo so...la combinazione \u00e9 strana ma fidatevi che merita tantissssssimo!!Perci\u00f3 andateci e Buon Appetito :DPS: l'unica pecca \u00e9 stato il dolce...mi pare si chiamasse dolcelatte fritto... :/dovrebbero rivederlo o farlo in modo diverso...per\u00f3 immagino e considero che l'obiettivo del locale non siano i dolci ovviamente....",

We put much of our choice into the hands of our server, Emilio, and he did an outstanding job - in terms of both food and wine.It was very much a sharing experience so we could sample a good part of the range on offer. Wafer thin tuna carpaccio, smoked tuna and dried tuna with homemade focaccia bread. Top quality and mouth-watering. The main course, a 900gm sirloin, with sides shared between us was one of the finest pieces of beef I have eaten. And, finally, a sublime cheesecake of such lightness and texture that completed a wonderful and very memorable evening. Buonissimo...and we'll be back.",

No biggie so far. But when we finally arrived at the restaurant we had to wait 20/30 minutes more for someone to come and get our order. The waiter brought us a little plate of cured meat and a bit of bread to make us wait (for 7 people).Then the waiter mixed up our orders, forgot to bring one dish of pasta, and then brought the other dish of pasta 15 minutes after everyone had been served with their main. Which means that one of the person was waiting for 15 minutes with no food.Waiters were welcoming and trying to be helpful. But service was not acceptable. we had to ask 5 times to get a jug of water for the table.Would not recommend this place if you want to eat a good main, Cured meat and cheese would be ok to go for.",

The restaurant was pretty much empty. It took 30min for starters to come, it was needing a bit more seasoning and portion were small. We ordered steaks to share and when it arrives, the so-called steak knives were blunt, probably the waiting staff were more focused on how to place the knife on the table their its actually purposes. Steak was fairly tasty, however everything was a disappointment. When our waiter asked hows our food, we said it needed more seasoning and apart from steak everything was average. The waiter just said ok and walked away.. obviously didn't really care what we said and probably won't feed back to chef. One of the worst dining experience in London.

        "Review: My friend and I wanted to have a sit down lunch instead of gran and go at Exmouth Market and we saw the advert outside this place Lunch Menu \u00a312.90. So we thought it wasnt too bad. Menu is complicated and pretentious to be honest, but we've ordered starter and main, and glass of red - the cheapest on wine menu which was \u00a36.50! And believe this place is not Grosvenor. It is very tiny and scruffy which I supposed should be part of the charm. The beef in the main course was tasty although expect gourmet portions. The starter however was a disappointment - I ordered prosciutto with cheese and instead of traditional cured ham I received something what looked and tasted like luncheon canned meat. Also the wine my friend chose was out of stock so the waiter offered her a glass of Pinot Noir. To our surprise the bills came at \u00a357! We asked the guy to double check as we ordered the lunch deal, he apologized and brought new one at \u00a354. It turned out the glass of basic Pinot Noir (which was offered as a replacement to the wine they didn't have) was \u00a311! That's more than a bottle of it from next door...also 12.5% service charged was already added to the bill ...we didnt have it in us to argue so we left. And of course we will never come back. It is a short term strategy guys. Happy customer is worth more than short term profit. Hope you will learn it one day.",

We finally seated and the same guy came to explain us the menu...fine and explain us how we could have a nice dinner trying different dishes... at the same time we asked for the wine list ( he did not bring with the main menu..) .. We ordered drinks( that they came after 15 minutes.... and what was really disappointed was that some (probably ) regular customers came after us and in 2 minuted they already had a bottle of wine on the table) and one of my friend ordered as Starter/Main a Pasta dish, and he was told him the past took 15 minutes to cook so maybe was not nice to let us keep waiting.. The way how he said that.. Disappointing ! Despite of that.. the pasta came as first dish in 9 minutes... and we were still waiting the Starters!! :) :) Apart from that... the food is excellent, we loved all the dishes...we had two cicchetti..and then a tuna and a steak tartare... following Tagliata Nuda.. with two sides.. and at the end: AMAZING cheescake and Tiramisu!!

We had a couple of recommended starters and mini-tapas, some were ever so slightly on the small size but they made up for it in taste 110%. The beef tartar and gorgonzola was out of this world. The mains were perfectly cooked and a great size. The wine list is lovingly curated and affordable. Highly recommended all round.",

        "Review: Don't get me wrong, I love meat but I found that the menu was mostly just meat and tuna (which I don't eat). However, if you enjoy both than you would find the menu most appetising. The raw beef dishes (circle) was very good but the Carpaccio was very plain. The steak was also quite bland and missing flavour. The chips were nice and so were the beans. We didn't order the spinach but they brought it out to us anyway. It was overcooked and not very enjoyable so glad it wasn't something we ordered.It was slightly loud in the restaurant as we were seated next to a large group. The service is friendly and the wines were very good. But it's a restaurant I would go back to as I prefer a bit of variety and it was a bit too much meat and tuna for my liking.",

The tuna carpaccio and ceviche just melt in your mouth, as do the rare meat dishes all aged over five weeks, and served as only the best beef from Italy, you cannot imagine how good this food is. Please on your first visit (it won't be your last) make sure you have the waiters give you an overview of the concept and the menu it is breathtakingly good. Can't wait to go back and try the pasta! Also the wine list is exceptional some very decent bottles at very reasonable prices ask for a recommendation we did and it was superb.

I'd probably eat there every day!Been there after eating many times at Macellaio in South Ken, so I was already expecting high quality, but my expectations were (if possible) exceeded. The new tapas concept is brilliant, you can taste and share a little bit of meat and fish starters which are simply delicious. Then the real chef specialty is the duo of steaks, beef and tuna... Their quality and taste will leave you speechless! If you can still eat, tiramisu and latte fritto are the cherry on the cake. Interiors are very well designed, wooden tables and cozy sofas which make you feel like home. The staff and owner are very welcoming and passionate in perfect Italian style.100% recommended!",

        "Review: Macellaio looks the business. Beautiful hunks of beef sliced to order and displayed to you before cooking, warm decor. Great wine list. Some lovely sliced cured meats. But overall we were a bit underwhelmed. As soon as I arrived, pretty much in the same breath as saying hello, we were told we'd only have the table for an hour and a half. I know restaurants need to have more than one sitting but to be rushed like that immediately, as we came in the door, didn't feel too welcoming (especially as then when we left there were lots of empty tables around anyway..)There's some talk about a 'concept' which basically boils down to 'steak and tuna are both meaty so we serve both of them'. Tune tartare was lovely but a beef carpaccio was underseasoned. Chips were anaemic, spinach overcooked and underseasoned, our steak was ok, a bit overcooked for us (we asked for rare) and was a little dry and underseasoned, which was a shame because it looked so impressive at the butchers counter. Plus there's a lot of nonsense - steak served under kloshes for no reason, sticking your steak knives into the table before your main and again with the bill. It's a lovely looking place with otherwise friendly service and I really wanted to love it, but there are definitely better steak places around and better places to eat on Exmouth market. Overall we were left feeling it was a case of style over substance.",

Anyway it was fine - sweet tender Italian meat but after the dramatic serving maybe I was expecting more than a simple piece of meat can deliver .Terrible caponata - al dente aubergine is something that should never be served & it was neither sweet or sour .Nice potato used in fries .Fried pastry balls stuffed with Nutella were sadly disappointing - ok with a coffee but I'd be a bit embarrassed describing it as a house speciality as they were by our waiter.The bill came in at the region that made me think of other places where I would have paid the same but they would have been-well let's put it simply - better ..",

The owner / maitre'd (?) was really patient in explaining the set up and the origin of the food and made sure we didn't over order. We had carpaccio of both and they were really beautiful. The sides were limited in choice but delicious, but then that's not really why you would come here. It was a bit disconcerting at first to have a butcher hacking great big ribs of beef on a block in the middle of the floor. I suspect a few blobs ended up on people's plates - but so what, when it's this fresh and tasty! Our only disappointment was the pud (fried milk balls). We should have either shared or not bothered, it was ok but not great. On the plus side,our primitivo was one of the best we have ever had - worth the trip alone. Service was genial and reasonably prompt (although can someone please tell the waiter in the low slung jeans that it's not a good look when you're thrusting your underpants in the face of the diners.

        "Review: From the moment of booking a table to leaving the restaurant, we could not have had a better experience.Walter and his team were incredibly attentive yet relaxed.The food was simple but soooooo tasty. Bravo!!!We warmed up with a Prosseco which was as smooth as a baby's bum! Lovely! The red wine from Piemonte was a great companion to the steak.We tried a range of starters (Heart of mozerella, tuna carpaccio, steak/Gorgonzola). They were all incredibly fresh and tasty.Now for the steaks! I had a 600g sirloin which was incredible and very well cooked. We shared spinach, roast potatoes and Mediterranean vegetable ( the carrots were the sweetest I have ever had). Bravo#2I am not sweet toothed but the cheesecake was sublime and the pineapple was very refreshing.The wine was good value for money and all washed down with strong espresso and amaretto.This is definitely going to become very popular, so get in quick!",

My husband had tuna tartare, this was also excellent.The quality of the ingredients is excellent and the cooked tuna and steak (mains) were also cooked to perfection. I was persuaded to have the potatoes with rosemary rather than triple cooked and it was good advice.Hadn't booked so we waited for a table for 30 minutes and were fed delicious snacks.Staff are welcoming and knowledgeable - I think our waiter should do stand up, very entertaining guy.Negatives:I suppose some people may not like concept restaurants.",

        "Title: Concept over content",
        "Review: \"This is not a restaurant\" our waiter claimed somewhat disingenuously. \"It is a butchers with tables\". It certainly looks like a restaurant but the conceit is designed to stress the provenance and quality of the meat. Actually, the explanation of the concept which is that they only serve beef and tuna (because tuna is really beef in fishy disguise) wore my patience a little. We were out for a family celebration and wanted to talk to each other not the (admittedly charming) waiter. The menu is confusing but essentially offers the same treatment to beef on the left page as to tuna on the right. You can have both as tartare, both as carpaccio etc. In the middle are the steaks. Impressive and large (400g is the smallest) which we didn't taste but were carried to other tables with ceremony and aplomb. Starting price for a steak was \u00a322. This is a restaurant that celebrates large portions and huge appetites if you stick to the main story.We strayed by tasting the smaller plates and they were fine. Not hugely original or surprising but the beef and tuna were of good quality and not messed about. But the portions were small. A tuna tartare for \u00a38 came as a disc the size of a jam jar top so you need several of them to satisfy even modest appetites; the restaurant's recommendation of 2 per person seemed light. We felt the choice was between a huge steak that felt intimidating or lots of small portions that left us asking for the menu back again.Deserts were poor. A tiramisu was big on cream but light on the base which meant it lacked both texture and taste. A chocolate cheesecake was rich but unremarkable. The bill for four of us including two bottles of wine and three prosecco was \u00a3215.",

        "Review: Abbiamo deciso di provare con alcuni amici Il Macellaio a Exmouth Market, avendo provato anche quello a Kensington. Lo stile del ristorante \u00e8 lo stesso, la novit\u00e0 \u00e8 l'uso del tonno rosso di Sicilia. Siamo stati inizialmente sorpresi dai prezzi (pi\u00f9 bassi rispetto al primo Macellaio) ma, come ci ha spiegato il cameriere, il locale punta sul men\u00f9 \"to share\", che f\u00e0 assaggiare un p\u00f2 del meglio. Optiamo per quella scelta quindi e non rimaniamo delusi. Tutto molto buono, mi ha sorpreso la tartare di tonno in particolare. Eccezionale la sirloin steak da 900g, curiosamente buono l'arrosto di tonno. Leggermente deluso dall'amatriciana di guanciale e tonno (quest'ultimo prevale un p\u00f2 troppo, a mio avviso, comunque buona). Piacevole sopresa, la selection dei dolci. Tutti homemade, davvero buoni, il gelato alla vaniglia e la brownie su tutti (mi ha ricordato un p\u00f2 la Tenerina ferrarese).In generale, grande attenzione al dettaglio anche nella presentazione dei piatti.Il servizio \u00e8 scenografico e molto competente, forse un p\u00f2 troppo \"pushy\".Peccato solo per il conto finale: due bistecche di tonno e una porzione di patatine che non abbiamo mai ricevuto (onestamente, non ci siamo ricordati nemmeno noi, presi dall'assaggio dei piatti). Cose che possono capitare, come ben s\u00e0 chi ha lavorato in un ristorante, specialmente in una serata molto busy. Fate attenzione anche ai vini e ai drinks. La lista dei prezzi era stata furbescamente rimossa al momento del consiglio sul vino da abbinare. Lo spritz a 9\u00a3 poi (!!!) non lo pago neanche allo Shard.Nel complesso, forse un p\u00f2 troppo caro rispetto alle porzioni.Molto consigliato per una mangiata di qualit\u00e0, da intendere pi\u00f9 come degustazione.",

        "Review: I've been to Macellaio a few times since I found this gem of a restaurantin Exmouth Market and each time has been absolutely fantastic. The decor issimple and authentically Italian which is also a great way to describe thefood. If you like steak and/or tuna, raw or cooked, the food is superb.Fresh, simple, tasty and very very good. The staff are very knowledgeableabout the menu, they know how the dishes are cooked and where the produceis sourced. It drives me crazy when you ask a waiter for an opinion on adish or for a recommendation off the menu and they say they don't know orhaven't tried it. Not the case here! The wine list is very good albeit withan Italian bias (which is to be expected) and the cocktails are fantastic. The bartender is clearly very experienced and just as passionate about wineand cocktails as the kitchen is about it's food. - As I mentioned, I'vebeen a few times already so have had the excuse to try a few fair bottlesof wine as well as the cheeky cocktail here and there.The last time I went was in the early evening and we were offered the barmenu. The waiter suggested the egg and salted tuna dish, which doesn't'sounds like a particularly appetising combination.... Oh. My. Goodness. Itwas absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it.If I had one criticism of the restaurant it would be that the egg and salted tuna dish is not on the dinner menu as well!",

        "Review: Macellaio has a very unique character, from the d\u00e9cor right down to the food, it really makes you feel like you've stepped off a London street and into an Italian local. I have been a couple of times now and every time the meat has been cooked to perfection, the fish has been fresh and the staff have been fantastically friendly. Having tried the one in South Ken I was keen to see what the latest edition had to offer and definitely was not disappointed. The quality of the food, the meat and fish in particular, is incredible. The sides are really tasty - they have all the essentials from veggies to roast potatoes to spinach.The starters, I mean, who knew raw meat could be so good? Normally not a huge fan of the raw variety but the tuna and steak carpaccio have me converted (I would highly recommend) - our waiter suggested we try a range of dishes which worked out really well as it meant we all got to try things we wouldn't usually order. Mains wise, you really can't go wrong. The beef and tuna steaks are both juicy and delicious. The pasta's are a solid classic - you can't call yourself Italian and not serve a good ol' aldente pasta, am I right? If you are looking for a few nibbles and drinks, the bar is ace. The bartender knows how to make some great classic cocktails. I find the sign of a good bar is one that can make a proper whiskey sour - for the record, I am not easy to please in this department but they passed with flying colors (and no, that's not the whiskey talking). All in all, I was really impressed. Good energy, excellent food, and great times. I'll definitely be going back. P.s. the soundtrack was great as well! Odd thing to notice but terrible soundtracks drive me crazy. It's not at all loud so that you can't chat or get distracted by it but it's just loud enough where if you would like to stop and appreciate a classic tune no one would blame you. It's the cherry on top of the gelato sundae really.",
