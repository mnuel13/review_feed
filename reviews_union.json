        "Review: My experience here was like Karen's diner but the waitresses aren't paid to be horrible, they just are. It was my grandma's 80th birthday trip and we arrived for our final meal excited for the great food and atmosphere ahead, how wrong we were! They didn't provide us with a warm welcome whatsoever, they made us feel like we were a problem from the minute we arrived. They didn't crack one smile, were extremely cold and rude and they spent most of their shift laughing and bitching about us like school girls. They made faces to each other which we could obviously see they were making about us when we would try to engage in conversation with them and lighten the mood. A PRE-WARNING - they stabbed our steak knives into the table extremely close to our fingers (this may be triggering for some people and there was no warning). I'm aware that this may be part of the steakhouse dining experience but in combination with their disgusting attitude towards us it felt rather threatening on the night. Unfortunately, they lead a member of our party to leave early due to the way they made him feel and ruined the final evening we had in London together. I have worked in hospitality myself and can understand the difficulty of the job sometimes but we were not hard customers, we just came to have a good time and were hoping they would look after our fabulous grandmother but that is not what they had in mind. Despite our experience, it at least gave us all a laugh to look back on for Nan's last meal of her fabulous trip.",

        "Review: Went there with friends on a last-minute whim at around 9pm in the evening on a Friday night and luckily they had a lovely table upstairs for the four of us. As two of us were very hungry, we ordered quite a few dishes to share:Starters:Focaccia : I was expecting a fluffy focaccia but what came was what looked like a very flat, thin pizza, which was not worth the price. Beef tongue : delicious, I would order again. Beef heart : equally delicious, and I would also order again. Bone marrow : the beef tartare on top of the bone marrow is overpowering; I much rather have the marrow on its own (which was delicious) and the tartar on the side. Truffle tagliatelle : there's a separate small truffle menu and we ordered the tagliatelle - it was basically a bowl of taglitelle which did not much sauce at all erring on the dry side - then the waitress came over with a weighing scale and truffle, weighed the truffle before and after she shaved some on the pasta for you to understand how much you have just spent ;-). This was the most disappointingly bland dish I have ever had and will never order anything from that truffle menu again. Mains:Beef rib steak : super delicious but do note down the weight as price is /100gr.Baby chicken : delicious but somewhat lonely without any side dishes. Overall, steak was definitely the best choice. Most of the starters were delicious but I would definitely not order focaccia nor truffle-dishes again.",

        "Review: I went here with a group of friends for dinner. Two of us ordered a steak to share and they said the minimum size was 700g, which we said was fine we\u2019d have that. They then brought us a steak and said it was nearly 1kg and was that ok, we said no, too big, that would\u2019ve been \u00a382 just for a steak. They then brought a second one which was only slightly smaller, and said it was difficult to get them any smaller than that because of the bone. If that\u2019s the case, why say the minimum is 700g? It felt very much like the sort of place where they just wanted to milk money out of us. The wine list was only available through a QR code and the cheapest bottle available was \u00a335, so we had that and it wasn\u2019t great wine, the sort you\u2019d pay \u00a36 for in the supermarket. Our steaks came and were much, much rarer than ordered. We ordered our big steak medium rare and it was essentially blue - it was stone cold in the middle and raw. Our friend ordered his steak medium and had to send it back it was so rare - and when it came back it was still undercooked but now also tough and flavourless. The chips were soft and not very nice at all - I\u2019ve had better chips in fast food places. We ended up asking for the service to be taken off the bill because the whole meal felt such bad value - though we felt bad because it wasn\u2019t really the staff\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just a bad restaurant. Even without service we paid \u00a360 each for two courses with one bottle of wine between four of us. There are many, many places in London which do the same food as this restaurant but much better and for much lower prices. Very disappointed, would not go again. Don\u2019t go.",

        "Review: Not very good. First of all, the wine list is exceptionally expensive but also missing prices, which makes purchasing wine awkward. Second, we ordered a sharing steak. Despite being told that there would be 700g available and ordering that, we were presented with a 940g. When we suggested we wanted what we ordered, they went away and brought back a 800g. That was still wrong by a large margin but we felt we had to go with it. When the steaks arrived they were bigly undercooked. One of our party sent his back to be cooked more, but they told us they just did this by putting it in the oven and when it returned it had lost flavour. We were too scared to do the same with our sharing steak. The chips leave much to be desired. Cooked unevenly and bad. Staff generally dismissive though some were OK, which is alright. Location slightly odd. Overall would not recommend.",

        "Review: We tried this restaurant for the first time this week, the reviews said it was great and we were in the area so thought we'd give it a go.The only Covid measure in place was a small bottle of hand sanitiser on the front desk - there were no measures in place in the rest of the restaurant, staff were 'wearing' masks but under their noses or just not wearing them at all, the toilets still had both male cubicles in use, with no hand sanitiser at all, and there was barely 1m between tables, with 3 other people being seated in tables that were literally next to us, despite the restaurant having more room. A member of staff also sat just outside the restaurant smoking, which was disgusting since the whole front of the restaurant was open, leading to smoke going across us while we were trying to eat.The food we had was great, until it came to the mains. There was a weird show of testosterone as the server stabbed our steak knives into the table, which seems like an immensely bad idea during a pandemic, since there's no way all of the small holes in the table could have been cleaned well. My partner's steak was decent, but very small and no better than a good quality supermarket steak. I opted for the lamb, which was over-cooked, a bit chewy, and lacked any flavour at all. Not the quality I would have expected for the price.Overall I definitely wouldn't come back here, especially with the absolute lack of Covid measures. The emphasis seems to be on theatrics rather than good food and service.",

        "Review: Booked a weekend lunch here and while we really enjoyed ourselves, it is sad that we were pretty much the only people in the restaurant. It is hidden down a side street off Union Street, and while only about a 10 minute walk from busy Borough Market, there is not much passing pedestrian traffic. The restaurant decor is really nice - it is in a railway arch, interesting paintings, wall hangings, lighting and an eclectic mix of tables and chairs. There is an upstairs but we stayed downstairs all the time. The service was fine - I would have been very surprised if it wasn\u2019t, given that we were alone. We both had the beef carpacccio starter, mine was plain, served with black pepper and olive oil, while my friend\u2019s was served with tiny pieces of whipped goats\u2019 cheese. We both really enjoyed it. She had a ragu pasta dish while I had a mini pizza type thing, again with fluffy light cheese and prosciutto crudo. Both were very enjoyable. We had glasses of the house montepulciano which was fine. The bill was not horrendous and we had a lovely relaxing lunch on a cold and windy afternoon. ",

Non abbiamo mangiato nulla sulla griglia, ma ho visto passare piati ben fatti. Per il servizio sicuramente ce spazio di miglioramento.

        "Review: I visited the restaurant for dinner. I came with high expectations and my expectations were raised with entrance to the restaurant as it was such a nice atmosphere and friendly welcoming. However, the food was a total disappointment. We ordered butcher salad, some fillet steak to share, roasted potatoes and spinach on the side and finally Tiramisu as desert. Let me start with Fillet steak. It came cold and when we asked the waitress she said because it is cooked in low heat to have medium-rare then we asked to be cooked a bit more. But again the meat came cold. We thought it was not freshly cooked, perhaps cooked earlier to serve. The side dishes were very plain, spinach was just simply boiled and served without and other flavours. Moreover, they were expensive for what you get. Tiramisu was full of cream but almost nothing else. Paying that much money for a dinner and getting total disappointment was the summary of my experience. My 2 stars go to waitress as she was nice and friendly.",

Personale super gentile, attento e la cameriera era super simpatica.

        "Review: In London for just one night, we were staying close by and looking for a nice restaurant as it was our wedding anniversary. I found Macellaio online and so glad I did. Our experience of Italian steaks had been good with the best living long in our memories at a restaurant along Lake Maggiore. Happy to say our experience of Macellaio will join that memory. Opting for the sharing table, the ambience was good. Service was excellent with lots of knowledge and pride in their offering. Our steaks were simply sublime. To impress my husband who has not ordered steak for a long time because he was constantly being disappointed was the icing on the cake. Loved that you can see the meat and the preparation. Top restaurant. Thank you ",

        "Review: Is not so easy to find a good fiorentina steak in London so we decided to give it at try to this restaurant famous for the fiorentina steak. We ordered in two 1kg of fiorentina and two sides, the steak quality was perfect like the one I have tried before in Florence, the restaurant atmosphere it\u2019s a bit too rustic-chic for me. The room was a bit smelly of smoke but this is probably coming from outside due to open windows because the air system looks new and perfectly working. I think this restaurant deserve 5 stars and the price (fiorentina is not cheap even in italy) is quite reasonable.",

        "Review: My wife and I decided to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary to Macellaio, Union Street.On arrival the table was not ready and their booking in the system was also different compare with mine one. I did book 7.45pm but for them my booking was at 8.15pm. Sounds weird. While we were waiting for the table the Manager ask us to have a drink in the meanwhile so, we sat down outside but unfortunately anyone came to us to take the order until the table was ready. Overall the waiting time was miserable too long considering that was Monday and the restaurant was not busy at all. We called the waiter to take our order otherwise anyone was considering us and just the waiting time for 2 simple glasses of wine was unacceptable. Due to kitchen electricity down the starters were served after 25 min but again anyone came to us reporting any kitchen issue earlier. However at least the quality of the food was excellent. After finished our dinner we were expecting someone to offer us the desert but again I had to call the waiter and ask for the men\u00f9 and also the bill. After the the lady to who I have asked the bill went to polish the cutlery and the Manager deliver the us the bill after nearly 10 min. By the time there was only 4 table in restaurant. We felt like not wanted and this is not a very good sensation because, quality food on the side, looks like having a normal dinner at home and this was not the porpouse of our dinner.As a client who have spent more than \u00a3100 I was pretending a better service and also more consideration from the FOH.Macellaio was on our bucket list for such a long time because we knew the brand and the quality of food and wine but after this experience I will never book again on this branch and will not also recommend that.",

Interesting presentation as the server will drive a steak knife into the table right in front of you.. They dry-age their own steak which is both good and not so good. If you want a steak medium, you need to order a cut thick enough to allow them to make it medium. Too much for one person, but since they cut it for you, I would recommend that you order a steak big enough to share with two or three. The lamb steak and the chicken is delicious. The host was very nice, and explained everything. The sides can be variable. Yes...it's expensive.",

Ho prenotato qualche mese prima chiedendo un piccolo aperitivo ed un messaggio da far trovare sul tavolo per il mio ragazzo, inutile dire che sono andati oltre le mie aspettative (messaggio su un foglio in stile pergamena e bicchiere di vino bianco meraviglioso, buonissimo).La cena \u00e8 stata fantastica, prodotti di alta qualit\u00e0, italiani (le etichette erano bene in vista), pasta al dente, carne ottima, vino indescrivibile. I dolci.. WOW! Personale gentilissimo, simpatico e moooolto paziente. Un ristorante che merita davvero di avere una buona, ottima, grandiosa fortuna! Staff giovane, caloroso, molto attento al cliente. Prezzi ottimi, specialmente se rapportati ai prodotti (sottolineo nuovamente, italiani) offerti.Super soddisfatti di tutto, dai prodotti al servizio, dalla location al conto.Torneremo sicuramente la prossima volta che saremo a Londra.E a chi vuole mangiare bene a Londra ANDATE AL MACELLAIO!",

We had the focaccia ligure (only stracchino cheese, as the original Italian one) and battuta as starters. Absolute great taste for both. We shared a 1kg fassona Fiorentina steak...flavour and tenderness second to none, you really have to try. We enjoyed the Latte Fritto dessert, never tried before and definitely a good new taste. The bill was at level we expected, this is not a cheap place but as always in high restaurant level you have to pay for excellence.

        "Review: Unlike the South Kensington venue, this Macellaios looks like a fast-casual diner. The place is very large, set over two floors, and the atmosphere is not intimate.The food remains delicious, as in other venues. They specialise in meaty dishes, and also have delicious wines and good desserts.Recommendations:- Pissas- Foccacias- Burrata- Battuta All\u2019Albese (although it does not come with truffle like in Italy)- Bone marrow (they add some kind of beef tartare on the usual marrow)- Beef Fillet- Rump steak- Fennel and orange salad- Mash potato - TiramisuLess amazing:- Fassona Bresaola (quite pricey for literally 4 slices)- Spinach side (nothing special)- Green tea pannacotta",

The service was outstanding and the food was so good that we ordered a second portion of steak tartar, not because we were hungry, it was simply magnificent.The Italian white wine on offer just didn't blow us away so the team patiently bought bottle after bottle for us to try until we found one that we did like. If you have cut back or simply only go out for celebration meals then make a point of putting this gem on the top of your list. Best rib eye steak I have ever eaten.",

        "Review: In occasione del mio onomastico ho avuto la fortuna di visitare questo Ristorante: vincitore della puntata a Londra del programma \u201c4 Ristoranti\u201d con lo chef Alessandro Borghese. Nato da un\u2019idea di Roberto Costa (nel 2012) \u00e8 un \u201cbutcher concept\u201d nel cuore di Southwark. E, se posso dirlo, un pezzetto del mio cuore questo posto lo ha conquistato. 100%Booking via web, siamo stati ricontattati telefonicamente da un ragazzo estremamente educato e cordiale per riconfermare i dettagli della prenotazione. Appena arrivati: un\u2019atmosfera moderna e sofisticata, familiare ed accogliente allo stesso tempo... con un gran Teatro che ospita il Macellaio e carni di qualit\u00e0 eccelsa. Accomodati al piano superiore siamo stati prontamente accolti da Maurizio (Manager & Sommelier) e da Aurora. Non avremmo potuto sperare di meglio!! Dopo un aperitivo Aperol Spritz abbiamo assaggiato un favoloso trittico (steak tartare-battuta all\u2019albese-battuta al Gorgonzola gustosissimo e delicato) consigliatoci da Aurora; lingua e focaccia. Ha fatto da padrona la nostra T-Bone: razza Fassona macellata rigorosamente dopo i 4anni e frollata 6-9 settimane; come spiegatoci con perizia e professionalit\u00e0 da Maurizio. Desserts favolosi: pannacotta al basilico e DolceLatte come da puntata in Tv. Abbiamo poi avuto l\u2019occasione di visitare il \u201cTeatro\u201d e di rubare qualche scatto che lascio qui con la recensione. :) GRAZIE. Veramente di quella che posso considerare ad oggi la MIGLIOR ESPERIENZA CULINARIA. EVER!! ",

Being a group of four we sat two across from one another, but thanks to the bizarre runway down the middle, we were so far away from the other couple we couldn't really converse. We moved to a square table when one became available without much fuss.The house wine had a faint fizziness which was unpleasant, but what was most disappointing were the size of the portions. Now, I am not a proponent of enormous portion sizes but the portion of the pesto pasta I had would barely fill a child. And I don't think the quality of the ingredients warrants the portion size. Just make it bigger and charge more! The rest of our party did thoroughly enjoy their steaks, but not wanting to order a barrage of sides, also left hungry.The service and food was good, but the meal was overpriced.",

Antipasto di battuta e focaccia al formaggio, con a seguire una steak con pere e sale grosso per me e un bel filetto per il mio lui, il tutto contornato con delle deliziose patate al forno.Niente dolce, ma caff\u00e8: quello italiano!Lo staff, composto in predominanza da italiani, \u00e8 cortese e gentile.Ristorante da provare in preda a un raptus di nostalgia di casa e a una voglia pazza di buona carne!",

Always good to find someone who speaks \"your language\" in terms of food.HOWEVER, in two instances he insisted we order dishes which HE would offer for free. We never say no to treats, so we tried both the salad and the desert he suggested. His exact words were like \"try the tiramisu, it's on me\".Finally though, when the bill came, he disappeared and the bill, of course, included the \"free\" dishes. It was so awkward. ",

        "Review: It sounded got from reviews and it looked good when arriving seeing meat hanging in at display in glass coolers in the back.Atmosphere was a bit strange with loud rock music which for me did not match the actually nice decor.The menu was made like a little newspaper and they had lots of good stuff.We ordered and within a short wait got our starter. I got some cold cuts with Parmesan and waited a bit before starting to eat to see if not any bread showed up but I guess I should have ordered that ? I think it is my first time at an Italian restaurant that I did not get bread???Starter was ok and our red wine arrived. The waiter poured and it was probably +25 degree C, so I asked for an ice cooler. The head waiter did also change our glass to some that was chilled and poured our wine over, but it took a while before it had a better temperature. So I did not really enjoy that bottle - which I have had in another vintage and loved.Our food arrived and my steak was really nice. My fennel /blood orange salad was also good even if there was just 2 pcs of blood oranges in it. We skipped dessert and coffee as we were not entirely happy with the place. Some of the food was really good but for me they had a few amateur flaws that takes my rating down. ",

        "Review: I had dinner there with two friends and their grandchildren (aged 7 and 11).Firstly the staff tried to place all five of us along one side of a long trestle table. After some discussion they offered a round table for 5. Why not do that first?And why have two long tables facing each other with a raised runway between them for the staff to serve from? How are people supposed to converse?We spent some time choosing our food and then a waitress turned up to explain how the menu worked! Strange way to behave. If the menu is so hard to understand why not explain it at the start? Pretentious was the word that came to mind.The children chose pasta. The adults wanted steak. The waitress brought a kilo piece of rib and explained that was right for 3 as the bone weighed quite a bit. I was dubious as it seemed too much to me but I was assured it was the right weight. We had a cheese stuffed foccacia to share, which was small. Something twice the size would have been more suitable for our party.The food arrived in dribs and drabs. The children's pasta portions were very small. One just had olive oil on the pasta and the other had a meat sauce. The charge was \u00a311 for each small bowl. The children were still hungry after they had eaten.The beef was good quality but too much for 3 so we had been sold a bigger weight of meat than we needed, despite my original misgivings about the size of the joint. The meat cost \u00a364.The vegetable portions were tiny. The roast potatoes were reheated and tasted unpleasant, the French fries were not very nice and the salad was truly boring.Pudding was fresh pineapple which was very nice but we had to wait ages for service.The wine was a very muddy and flabby Sangiovese at I think \u00a338. It tasted as if it had been stored at too high a temperature.My total bill for a very uninspiring meal was \u00a3186, which was excessive for what we had. My conclusion was that we had been pressured into paying too much for the meat, the pasta was wildly over priced and the vegetables were not appetizing. I could have bought the wine on the Internet for less than a third of the price I was charged.I would definitely not go back.",

He was there previously with friends and she welcomed him completely ignoring me and the other guy at the table for the first few minutes, after that she got the orders crouching on his side and putting her hands on his chair. The rest of the staff, the manager (a Greek guy) and the other waitress (Aurora) were instead extremely nice an professional and we got free coffe, liquors and dessert as apology for the steak we mentioned to be too cooked.Overall good experience but as area of improvement I would suggest to train part of the staff to be friendly but maintain professionalism.",

        "Review: While staying at Mercure Hotel in Southwark Street we wanted a restaurant that was close by for Sunday evening. Strolled through Old Union Street Arches which was 5 minute walk from hotel and came across this little gem. Apparently there are at least three other branches in London but it came across as being a one off. It's basically a steak restaurant, although pizzas etc are available. The waitress showed us to our table and asked if we had been before. She then proceeded to show us the ropes, explaining the restaurants ethos and where the food was source etc. She then pointed us to 2 large chilled cabinets that were full of large beef joints displayed for all to see. Looking at the display I assumed we were in for a good meal and were not disappointed. We started steak tartare for my wife and Menabrea with gorgonzola for myself. This is basically steak tartare with gorgonzola or dolcalette (I forgot) cheese on top which was then blowtorched at the table to melt the cheese.Both were exceptional starters, not too large or small and very tasty.Followed this with rump steak with pears which was brilliant. The ubiquitous hand cuts chips were really good too. They have a smallish range of desserts and the apple cake was brill. Wine list was on the pricey side but this is London after all.All in all , a great place , fantastic staff and excellent food. Could not have asked for more.",

The bresaola was lovely - sweet & savoury, served simply with rocket & a very firm burrata-style cheese & cherry tomatoes.

        "Review: I booked this restaurant as it was convenient to The Union theatre to have a celebration meal in after the show. It is primarily for steak lovers but there are a few other dishes available. The friend I was with is in a wheelchair and the staff could not have been more helpful in making sure that our table was suitable for a wheelchair. When it came to choosing what to eat the relevant cut of steak was shown to you and explained what the cut of meat was and how was the best cooking idea ( (Rare etc) to suite the cut thus enabling you to make a decision as to what weight/cooking you wanted. The meat is hung for a number of weeks and is refrigerated and on view in chill cabinets. As this was my friends 80th birthday they made the evening feel special by providing a few little extras which was unexpected. We felt no pressure to rush our meal and get out and in fact stayed and had a leisurely 3 hour dinner. We ate early in the evening and if our table had been needed we would have vacated. By the time we left which was about 20:00 the restaurant was filling up quite well and from what I could see the other customers all received the same sort of service. The restaurant bills itself as Italian because the meat all comes from Italy. We had sides of vegetables which were quite sufficient for two to share. A very enjoyable experience.",

        "Title: Prepare for pushy staff and overly salty food!!",
        "Review: This wasn't a bad meal. Food was good - just very salty!We were shown to an upstairs table, but asked if we could move as there was an overhanging sign on the wall which would have got in the way. This wasn't an issue and we moved to a different table. Chairs weren't very comfortable - but matched the 'industrial' theme. Our waitress came over while we were still looking at the menus and advised us on what the most popular (and most expensive) dishes were. Don't be fooled by the price per kg - the waitress tried to sell us 1.2 kgs of meat to share, which would have been a LOT and very expensive (roughly \u00a36-8 per kilo). We told her we didn't want this much and would get a few sides to go with it. She then told us not to overload on sides (\u00a34.90 each), but to get starters instead as she thought we'd still be hungry, We didn't get starters, but ordered a sharing bread. Again the waitress tried to up sell this and wanted us to buy a plate of meats, however we had to decline this offer a few times!! We had already chosen a bottle of red wine, but when we told her what we wanted, she told us we should get a different, 'stronger, full bodied' red, despite the one we chose being one we liked. She told us the one we chose was 'easy drinking'. She probably didn't like the fact it was one of the cheaper ones on the menu. We enjoyed the food - although had more than enough meat at 1kg. We had a side of potatoes and a side of spinach. Small, but enough to share. Very salty! Probably another technique to sell more drinks!!One of the waiters was passing by when we were pouring out the wine and straight away took away the bottle and asked if we wanted another, despite having another full glass each! We said no, although a different waiter still brought over a new bottle!! We had to tell him it was a no first time!! If you like good meat, this place is good. Just don't let the staff push you to order what you don't want!!",

        "Review: I decided to take my girlfriend for Valentine's dinner as she always wanted to try the food here.She is a chef and we both have been working in hospitality first in Italy and then in the UK for a long time. Being really interested in this restaurant we booked a table, we were welcomed by a girl at the door, very attentive and welcoming. We sat at our table and three different people came over to take the drinks orders. We got our bottle of wine, quite nice. After getting our bottle of wine we were left for more than 30minutes with our menu. I straight away realised that only a girl was taking orders while the other guy was running food and drinks, we were sat upstairs. When i asked this guy if we could order i was told yes, then he kept on setting up empty tables without even bothering to come over and tell us that only his colleague was taking the orders and that she would have been with us shortly, it is not my job to assume that she can only take orders. I called him a second time and I was told \"Yes\" again but he never came to our table. My apologies to the girl cause i think i was quite upset when she came over to take our order - she was doing the best she could however her colleague should learn to talk to people not just ignore them. We got to order and after waiting half an hour i was told that what i wanted was not available \u2013 normally you should inform the customers once you leave the menus but again the guy didn\u2019t bother, I didn't mind so I changed my order. We had Prosciutto Crudo and Bresaola as starters - nothing special, the quality of the charcuterie was not so bad however the portion was ridiculous and the Stracchino was off. The Pissa Marinara was nice however the tomato sauce was tasteless and a very bad quality. What disappoint me the most was my meat - I was expecting a higher quality and a bigger portion, let alone that the meat was served Rare when I asked for Medium- Rare always better to be undercooked than overcooked in my opion, however as a steak house the cooking of the meat should be impeccable. the Costata was nothing special too. The hand cut chips were not nice at all and the roast potatoes were not too bad. I was so disappointed because this is considered one of the best italian restaurants in London but i do not think the same after visiting, it is a real shame because you would never serve this kind of food (quality wise) in Italy.I was expecting something from this restaurant that was completely deceived. We spent \u00a3140 the two of us for not a so special meal. We would never come back again.",

        "Review: I brought the masterclass as a Xmas gift for 2 of us. We'd been asked to arrive for 7pm, so choose to arrive 5mins early- however found the class had started when we got there. We'd luckily only missed a few minutes.The class takes place above the restaurant, on an upper open planned 2nd floor. The chef taking the class had a lovely, albeit softly spoken Italian accent, which unfortunately got drowned out a midst the restaurant music & noise from below. I'd assumed it'd be in a different room or the chefs may have mics at least to help us hear what was being said; I did offer this as a recommendation after. It was a lot of listening and not as hands on as I'd hoped, but still the bits we heard were interesting and the meat was impressive.We felt a little awkward as the class was already settled when we arrrived- so we appreciated the quick re-cap by one of the team, but it was 45mins later until we were offered a drink as the session was still going. This aside, the wine was great.The chef made a French and an Italian steak tartare which we all got to try- it tasted amazing. So too did the 3x course meal that followed inc cured meats, fresh garlic bread, steak & vegetables and a trio of desserts. It was all cooked incredibly well.The staff were friendly and service smooth. It's an expensive gift but seemed good as a unique treat. However, in retrospect, we'd probably skip the class which held little value unfortunately, and just go for the dining bit which was hands down the best part. We're keen to visit the other Macellaio- but certainly just to dine next time.",

And the sides.. to small. The roasted potatoes were dry, while the spinach and mash just average. We ordered a ligurian pizza which was really small.

The wines are a bit expensive.Service is kind and they explain perfectly the way they made all the dishes in the menu.One weaky point is timing of serving.

        "Review: A combination of factors had me looking for a Wednesday evening dinner for me and my daughter in the Southwark area.Having previously enjoyed Union St Cafe, we tried there, but they were booked for a private event. The ever helpful kitchen team did ask if I\u2019d like a recommendation though, and accepting the kind offer, we were directed to Macellaio.The very enthusiastic recommendation was completely deserved, with great food and excellent service. Whilst not strictly a \u201cfamily\u201d targeted restaurant (ie no specific children\u2019s menu) they accommodated my daughters requirements very well. She had a pizza (without dairy) that she described as \u201cawesome\u201d. The quality of the meats (over all we had 4 dishes), spoke volumes when being eaten. The ingredients were allowed to speak for themselves as such.If we didn\u2019t have steak waiting to be cooked at home, the fridge containing the racks of meat was extremely tempting and appetising, and might have swung me away from the pasta options. It says something when my daughter was asking if we could visit every week, and listing who she\u2019d like to take along too. It was a long list.It\u2019s unlikely to be possible to visit every week, but is definitely one to return to soon. Very soon. ",

        "Review: Sono stata in questo ristorante con degli amici, ricordandomi della puntata di '4 ristoranti' ed avendo voglia di mangiare carne. Il locale ha uno stile ricercato ed un po' drammatico. Il servizio \u00e8 molto attento e cortese, i piatti arrivano velocemente e sono ben curati. Il cibo \u00e8 semplicemente fantastico! La qualit\u00e0 della carne \u00e8 altissima e trattata con molta cura, cosa che si apprezza nel cotto ma ancora di pi\u00f9 nel crudo. Il prezzo \u00e8 un po' salato, per\u00f2 contando le materie prime offerte, \u00e9 ben giustificato. In totale abbiamo ordinato due antipasti di crudo, una fiorentina da 1kg da dividere in due ed una tagliata, un contorno, due dolci, un caff\u00e8, una bottiglia di acqua ed una di cabernet per una spesa di 149\u00a3. Lo consiglio per una cena con amici, nella quale si vuole fare una bella figura e mangiare carne di buona qualit\u00e0.",

        "Review: I found this restaurant after visiting Tate Modern. The staff seem mainly to be Italian, and are very pleasant, with efficiernt, friendly and unobtrusive service. There are chill fridges containing interesting looking large cuts of beef, all well aged; it's obvious they take their meat seriously here (they call it Butchery with Tables). However, as it was lunchtime we were in the mood for something lighter and ordered the Focaccia Pizzata, which turned out to be a rather unusual and completely delicious pizza with a double very thin base with light cheese between the layers and topped with tomato sauce, beautiful olives, capers and anchovies. Although they have other outlets, this dish doesn't seem to be available at the others. The music was excellent and perfectly suited to the clientele (also lots of Italians, who all seemed to know each other, lots of hugging and animated chat). The coffee they serve is really delicious. An excellent find, I am looking forward to an evening visit, when I shall try their excellent-looking meat.",

Both amazing.Ravioli with al tocco were good, nothing over the top but still very nice.The two steaks we ordered (skirt stake and rump steak with goronzola) were stunning, absolutely delicious!

We were initially heading to Bala Baya but as this restaurant was right next door we had trouble walking past the people dining outside with what looked to be lovely steaks on their plates. This ended up being a great decision. I believe our waiter was Enzo and he was amazing and very attentive. Not sure what Lemoncello we had to finish off the evening meal but was the best we had and we tried a lot of it during our time in Italy. This dinner was a highlight of our trip. Food, service and ambiance upstairs was just fantastic. Meal certainly wasn't cheap but not a lot was in England compared to Italy. Would definitely go back if we ever got back to England again.",

Innanzitutto il locale si trova all'interno di un piccolo cortile e non \u00e8 facilmente individuabile dalla via principale virgola tant'\u00e8 che abbiamo impiegato un pochino per trovarlo. All'interno dello stesso cortile c'\u00e8 anche un altro locale il che non rende facile l'individuazione. Forse influenzati dal l'idea che ci eravamo fatti guardando il programma televisivo, una volta entrati siamo rimasti un po' delusi dalla dimensione del locale, molto pi\u00f9 piccolo e Modesto di quanto ci era sembrato in tv. Il servizio e cordiale Cortese virgola giovane e informale. Ci hanno fatto accomodare nella sala sul soppalco che risulta un po' cupa e poco illuminata ma arredata in stile moderno e piacevole . Il men\u00f9 \u00e8 piuttosto vario e i prezzi non certo abbordabili, il che \u00e8 ampiamente giustificabile per i piatti a base di carne , dei quali abbiamo potuto apprezzare l'eccellente qualit\u00e0, ma molto meno giustificabile in riferimento ai piatti di pasta o agli antipasti. Pertanto Sconsiglio di abbinare ai piatti di carne o un primo o un antipasto perch\u00e9 totalmente fuori prezzo.

Choices in starters perhaps not as varied as other I\u2019d like from a restaurant and it was my own opinion that a choice of accompanying sauce would also been nice but they don\u2019t have this choice.I would rate this place second to another chain of well known steak establishments. Overall very pleased and reasonably priced. I would go back to try the other variety of steak.",

        "Review: Macellaio is an Italian steakhouse situated under the railway arches on Union Street about 200m from Southwark tube station. The restaurant has a nice cosy atmosphere and the food is excellent. On our visit the place wasn't full and had a good vibe but our experience was slightly let down by a service mistake as a result of the servers trying to impress by remembering everything instead of writing it down, and as a result forgetting two things from the order. It's not rocket science, just write it down and avoid this issue. I'd rather have the confidence that you got my order correct than be impressed with your memory tricks.Even though the place wasn't full our mains still took a very long time to arrive but the manager spotted the problem and brought us a plate of cured meats to keep people's mouth's occupied while our steaks were prepared.The steaks themselves were excellent, I thoroughly recommend avoiding the high pressure \"upsell\" for the T-Bone or Rib Eye specials (and the associate cost) and suggest the rump steaks which were tasty and very tender.",

        "Review: Not surprisingly this restaurant is heavily biased towards the meat eater. 2 of us went there one a carnivore and the other a veggie. On the positive side the the steak was very good, there is a good extensive wine list and the service was very good. On the negative side the 2 veggie options I ate were not great. The cheese and leek tart was burnt and the pesto pasta bitter tasting and lacking in seasoning. I ordered ice cream for dessert, but they discovered they had run out and as I did not want an alternative they gave us a glass of wine free. In my opinion if you are going to provide veggie options at least make an effort!The toilet facilities were also not up to scratch. The ladies had obviously not been checked for sometime and the door to the ladies which opened directly onto the restaurant kept opening. Apparently in the men's toilet there was a large hole in the wall.",

        "Review: A small of group us done our usual thing of going to a restaurant after seeing a film, in this instance, \"Thor:Ragnarok\".Firstly I'd like to mention that it was my first visit to \"Macellaio\" whereas the others have been previously and talked good things. Like other reviewers the restaurant is hidden along Union Street heading towards the Shard/London Bridge.The atmosphere for a Wednesday evening was jovial and not packed to the rafters. Quiet enough to have a decent conversation but not overly loud where you had to scream/shout to hear each other or extremely quiet where you can hear other patrons conversations.My starter was penne pasta with tomatoes. I was clearly impressed that the pasta seemed to be freshly made and tasted good. I chose \"rabbit\" as my main meal accompanied with salad and cherry tomatoes. The rabbit was cooked well and was decent. As it is was my first tasting of rabbit I cannot really judge on its quality.Did not order any alcohol but the wine list seemed to offer a good selection though no Rose was available to purchase. Did not look at the dessert menu so I shan't comment on dessert.All in all, it was a satisfactory dining experience but in my opinion nothing really above the ordinary.Will go again to sample their steaks as that seemed to be their speciality.",

Italian food is something that not many people understand, especially in the British capital and more often I've come to the conclusion that there is only one way to experience it: in Italy. I visited Macellaio a couple of days ago with a group of friends and it tasted like home. We tried a couple of starters, bruschetta with lardo, the steak tartare, battuta with gorgonzola and the Ligurian pissa with ham. They were simply divine. As a main, we opted for a rib-eye steak and I have rarely had meat that tasted so good during my years in London: it melted in my mouth.The sides were also good but The service was excellent, we were sitting upstairs and the waitress was incredibly nice and answered all the questions my British friends had about the menu and explained exactly why the meat is so special.I will definitely come back and bring more friends; I am so happy I found this restaurant. It is a real Italian food experience.",

        "Review: The meal started so well with friendly, attentive service explaining about the source and flavour of the meat they use and guided us nicely on starters and weight of meat to use for the mains. The selected starters were excellent and it all set the scene nicely. Unfortunately, the main courses were a real let down; the rump steak was raw when we asked for medium rare and when it returned 5 minutes later looked no different. My wife and I shared a 700g rib steak and this too was an incredible disappointment. The long ageing process hadn't added flavour and we were barely left with the equivalent meat of two 6 ounce steaks after the lumps of fat had been removed. The platter that the rib was served on contained more fat than meat. My daughters pasta dish was good but she was left still hungry such was the small portion size. The manager provided complimentary deserts but the damage had been done and the experience was ruined. It ended up an expensive meal and to add insult the bill included a service charge that took account of the complimentary deserts!",

        "Review: A couple of weeks ago we looked in at Macellio in Exmouth market. I looked amazing for meat lovers. All that tasty meat hanging in fridges. Looking rather impressive. We salivated at the thought, but had just eaten. So yesterday, being back in London for a very special appointment we thought we try Macellaio for an iron, protein injection of really good steak!! We were early so only a couple of other covers. I ordered rump steak with Olive oil and salt. My partner ordered the beef shoulder steak. We had 2 sides. A bean dish which was tasty and broccoli with fresh chill but only 1 sliver of chill..... my steak was under done and really chewy and a little cold! I also didn't like the way it was presented, all sliced up and fanned out on a hot slate! Didn't look nice! The should steak was also cut up into tiny slivers that filled a plate. It looked grey!! That too was chewy. I sent my rump steak back. Now I know rump steak isn't the best cut of steak, but cooked well it can be very tasty and this just wasn't! My next steak was just as bad.... I sent that back too. So after sending my first steak back I sat and watched my partner eat his and our sides which were going cold not happy and the whole meal was a disappointing disaster! ",

The interior looked nice, but you don't often get the chance to eat outside in London. The restaurant is well hidden down a little hidden street that has a few bars and restaurants. We shared focaccia stuffed with cheese to start and it was delicious. Really tasty. We followed that up with a 1kg rob eye, done medium-rare, with a couple of sides. I am. It sure I have ever eaten better steak than that and I have eaten in many good steak places. Was absolutely delicious. Flavoursome and seasoned well, but also melted in the mouth. Absolutely fabulous. We washed it down with a nice Barolo. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Overall a fantastic experience and we shall definitely be returning",

        "Review: Oh so glad we went here based on TA reviews and only 80m from the hotel. Great atmosphere in a converted railway arch in a trendy redevelopment. But don't let that fool you this place is seriously good food. We opted for focaccia made on site stuffed with various filling, mine being cheese. The size of a pizza and very thin but with real unique fresh crusty bread taste smothered in cheese. My friends air dried beef was as good while the other friend was reluctant to share his as it was so good!!! We decided to try the speciality of 6 week air dried rib of beef on the bone. The raw meat was brought for our approval before cooking and a slab weighing 1.5kilo looked as unctuous as it tasted after being cooked medium rare. Although it cost \u00a390 to be fair three 14oz steaks would set you back the same if not more in town. No need for serrated steak knives as the meat just fell apart and melted in the mouth. In fact the four sides of chips, parmentier potatoes, sprouting broccoli with orange and crusted fine beans were a mere distraction. The beef was simply the best and most flavoursome I've eaten for about 20 years. We accompanied it with a very nice Primitivo which was so good that we had a second bottle and at only \u00a330 a btl excellent value. Can't comment on desserts as we were too full! The staff are excellent and the maitre d' made the whole experience enjoyable - attentive, knowledgable but not intrusive. Top of my list of places to revisit when next in London. ",

The restaurant is very informal and has a great ambience. This restaurant really does meat superbly well. The fassona (special breed of cattle from Piedmont) is sublime. I am able to buy this from my local Italian deli but it was a pleasure to be able to eat in a restaurant here in London. The fillet was just so succulent, full of flavour ; I went to meat heaven. My husband had the rump with pear and balsamic which was excellent too.There is an extensive wine menu with some interesting (in a good way) selections. No room for pudding.

        "Review: A party of 5 on a Wednesday for dinner. Macellaio is located near Waterloo train station in one of those little alley where you can find 5 other restaurants/bars. The mood is easy going and eating outdoors is possible. Easily accessible via Southwark tube station, no easy car parking nearby. I would recommend booking in advance to avoid disappointment. Each person had a starter, main course, and dessert. For drinks wine, beer, mineral water. The bill came to a total of \u00a3279, with service at 12.5% included. Our waitress was agreeable, discreet and efficient. The starters were of good quality, the main course for all was mainly steak. The steak were cooked as per instructions, but the meat was a bit young and could have been a bit more mature. The desserts were not up to scratch and frankly did not taste good. One Suppe Inglese was by far the weirdest dessert I have ever eaten, and the flavour really surprising but not in a good way. Very sour/bitter. The deep fried milk and chocolate balls at least each 300KCal, and frankly a bit bland. The experience was satisfying but I feel the claim to fame for Macellaio not up to scratch. FYI the people around the table are very frequent global travellers who on average eat out 10-15 times a month.",

        "Review: Sono andato a cena nel ristorante di Union Street per il mio compleanno. Il locale \u00e8 molto bello e colpisce subito. Calorosa l'accoglienza. Ci siamo accomodati al nostro tavolo (che pur essendo vicino alla porta non subiva spifferi di alcun tipo) e, poco dopo, il cameriere, ci ha portato il men\u00f9 particolarissimo (fatto come se fosse un giornale). Ci siamo affidati a lui chiedendo consiglio su quali fossero i piatti migliori. Notando la competenza del cameriere ci siamo fidati (e abbiamo fatto benissimo). Abbiamo iniziato con qualche fetta di salame di fassona (davvero squisita). Abbiamo poi continuato con una focaccia ripiena di stracchino saporita e delicata allo stesso tempo (io e mia moglie la consigliamo davvero). A seguire due Tartare, una appena condita per saggiare il sapore e la consistenza della carne, una pi\u00f9 saporita, con gorgonzola sciolto sopra. Entrambe davvero fantastiche. A questo punto siamo passati alla costata da 600gr. Prima che la cucinassero, il responsabile di sala l'ha portata al nostro tavolo per farci valutare se la qualit\u00e0 e la dimensione fossero di nostro gradimento. Nonostante lo spessore, essendo carne di altissima qualit\u00e0, si scioglieva in bocca. Ad accompagnare la carne un pane buonissimo, delle patate arrosto semplicemente fantastiche e dei broccoletti anch'essi buonissimi. Nonostante fossimo davvero pieni siamo passati ai dolci. Il dolce al basilico \u00e8 davvero qualcosa di meraviglioso... consiglio di prenderlo a fine pasto perch\u00e9 ti lascia con quella piacevolissima sensazione di freschezza. La torta al cioccolato era semplicemente perfetta. Il tiramis\u00f9 molto buono e delicato \u00e8 stata la chiusura perfetta per mia moglie. Il conto un po' salato per lo standard a cui sono abituato ma non certo quanto mi aspettavo. Considerando l'ambiente, il servizio e la qualit\u00e0 delle materie prime, mi aspettavo di pagare ben oltre le 100\u00a3 invece mi sono ritrovato anche un piccolo sconto come regalo di compleanno. Davvero attentissimi al cliente e carinissimi. Consiglio a tutti gli amanti della buona carne di andare a mangiare in questo ristorante... merita davvero.",

The food was fantastic, we ordered a pasta dish and pissa- both well worth a repeat, well cooked with great taste.The bar manager was also very welcoming (though we didn't know he was the bar manager at the time)- such a lovely vibe. The wine menu is well curated- well worth a visit for that alone. If you like your italian well done (food or otherwise!) this is a must visit and very highly recommended!

On this occasion we visited with another couple to celebrate our 50th birthdays and were sat at an extremely spacious table table next to the window into the meat fridge. Carnivores can enjoy the most flavoursome steaks that I've tasted in London. Many places in our capital serve great tasting steaks but not on a par with these !

        "Review: Siamo un gruppo di 15 persone e siamo stati qui a mangiare sulla scia del fatto che lo avevamo visto sulla trasmissione \" i 4 ristoranti \" su Sky. Naturalmente in TV ne hanno parlato molto bene ma senza telecamere le cose non stanno proprio cos\u00ec. Appena seduti al tavolo prenotato il cameriere si \u00e8 predisposto subito con il solito turistico \" faccio io\", non lo so, forse per far su conto, intento sicuramente riuscito o per fare bella impressione con la propriet\u00e0. Mi ha riportato all'insistenza dei venditori porta a porta degli anni 90.Alcuni di noi hanno ordinato una tartare come antipasto, perch\u00e9 vista sul loro sito web ufficiale, ed invece \u00e8 arrivata una porzioncina da 30/40 grammi, neanche parente di quella mostrata sul sito. Una vera delusione, a questo punto facciamo notare la cosa e ci viene risposto che vale per gli altri ristoranti e non per il loro. Allora io mi chiedo o togliete quel piatto dal sito web che vi rappresenta o fatela uguale agli altri, giusto!?!il pane \u00e8 arrivato 5 minuti dopo l'arrivo degli antipasti, fin troppo seguiti prima dell'ordine e troppo poco dopo.Di secondo sono arrivate le costate e fiorentine a \u00a3. 6/6,5x100gr. cotte bene.Ultimo il vino, ne abbiamo ordinate diverse bottiglie durante la serata e ogni volta che ordinavamo la sostituzione di una finita il cameriere \"porto anche l'altra\". Abbiamo pagato poco meno di \u00a3.90 a testa ma naturalmente il posto per le sue caratteristiche si posiziona sul medio/alto come prezzo, ma il nostro non \u00e8 stato problema di prezzo ma di servizio e di comunicazione, che secondo me \u00e8 i miei commensali sono completamente da rivedere.Per stare sul format \"i 4 ristoranti\"Location 7Men\u00f9 8Servizio 3Conto 5",

        "Review: Ancora una volta cena fantastica in questo ristorante! Dopo una visita alla Tate Modern, sono tornata con il mio ragazzo a cena in questo ristorante. Il locale \u00e8 molto bello, l'atmosfera piacevolissima. Conosciamo bene la carne del Macellaio, che \u00e8 davvero squisita, ma questa volta non mi dilungher\u00f2 nell'esaltare la qualit\u00e0 e il gusto di quest'ultima. Ci siamo infatti concentrati su pizza e focaccia al formaggio - visto che avevamo un po' malinconia della nostra Genova! Che posso dire? Davvero squisite... Io ho scelto una pissa con stracchino e prosciutto cotto, davvero buonissima... Il mio ragazzo invece ha optato per la pissa classica con le acciughe, e ne \u00e8 rimasto davvero entusiasta! La chicca finale \u00e8 stata condividere la focaccia al formaggio: preparata e cotta a regola d'arte. Pizze e focacce davvero goduriose, saporitissime ma allo stesso tempo leggere!Consigliatissimo!! E ce n'\u00e8 davvero per tutti i gusti, per i pi\u00f9 o meno 'carnivori', e per i pi\u00f9 o meno amanti del glutine!!!",

Fantastically over the top, and actually rather fantastic food too - we shared burrata, prosciutto and bresaola, plus some amazing mozzarella as a starter and then shared a T-bone steak between 3 of us. It was beautifully textured and bursting with flavour. It was pricey, and our only gripe was that service, while smiley, was a bit slow - we waited 20 minutes for our drink order to be taken.

        "Review: In quattro giorni di soggiorno a Londra, ho avuto il piacere di pranzare e cenare nei tre Ristoranti \"Il Macellaio RC\" di Roberto Costa. In tutti tre i locali io e la mia famiglia siamo rimasti letteralmente impressionati dalla bont\u00e0 e dalla genuinit\u00e0 dei cibi serviti da personale competente, disponibile, affabile e sempre pronto ad accertarsi che tutto fosse di nostro gradimento, mettendoci al corrente, ad ogni portata, della provenienza e della preparazione di ci\u00f2 che ci accingevamo a mangiare e bere. Il locale in 229, Union Street \u00e8 accogliente e dall\u2019atmosfera rilassante. Ci siamo praticamente sentiti in casa nostra. Tipici e dal sapore unico gli antipasti come la focaccia al formaggio e la \u201cpissa\u201d all\u2019Andrea; le battute di carne cruda al Gorgonzola e all\u2019Albese; la Fassona tonnata (veramente speciale); burrata; mozzarella di bufala e prosciutto crudo. Uniche le lasagne al pesto (naturalmente Genovese) e l\u2019inimitabile ed eccellente \u201cfiorentina\u201d di 2,4 kg. dal sapore e dalla morbidezza pi\u00f9 uniche che rare, circondata da contorni quali spinaci (da assaggiare assolutamente), potatoes e broccoli. Mai mangiata carne cos\u00ec buona in vita mia! Il tutto accompagnato da una vasta scelta di vini sapientemente suggeriti dal personale ed adatti ai cibi consumati. Per finire mix di dolci come zuppa inglese, cheese cake e il delicatissimo ed unico \u201cbianco al basilico\u201d. Complimenti vivissimi al titolare Roberto Costa che abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere e di renderci conto che \u00e8 veramente una persona semplice ed unica sia nel rapporto con la clientela che col personale: secondo me \u00e8 il datore di lavoro che tutti vorrebbero! Abbiamo visto anche la trasmissione di Alessandro Borghese \u201c4 Ristoranti\u201d e siamo pienamente d\u2019accordo che \u201cIl Macellaio RC\u201d di Roberto Costa sia risultato il miglior ristorante Italiano a Londra: la sua competenza in materia e il suo gesto finale non fanno che avvalorare la mia stima nei suoi riguardi.

        "Review: London has many good steak restaurants, and many good Italian restaurants, but this amazing little place tucked away in a new foodie alley in Southwark combines them both beautifully. I finally got to try focaccia con formaggio (which an Italian colleague had been telling me about for years) which made for a wonderful starter, then braved the raw meat tartare selection. The highlight was the Fassona steak, easily on par with dedicated steakhouses like the Gaucho. The service was a winning blend of charm and knowledge, with the sommelier introducing me to an Italian Malbec (something I didn't realise even existed!) which was divine. And the restaurant is next to one London's quirkiest pubs, the Lord Nelson, so gets another thumbs up from me!",

        "Review: Had a really nice meal here - to be honest I found it better than any of the Hawkmoors in London.Atmospheric set-up under the arches with full view of the kitchen and bakery (depending what level you sit) and excellent service.All ingredients are sourced from Italy with arrivals 2-3x a week apparently. You come here primarily for the meat which is Fassona (connoisseurs know how quality this breed is) and the cut we had was prepared simply and mouthwatering....some of the best red meat I have ever had and certainly so in London.Actually, we also had great focaccia and 'Pissa' (think Pizza but lighter) and truly exceptional desserts.The wine list requires care as some bottles are really expensive but there is a solid selection of Italian reds at \u00a330-50.I thought it was decent value for money and a great experience overall. Now my favourite go-to place for meat in town.",

Appena seduti ci hanno anche offerto un tagliere piccolino con del salame di fassona e la focaccia fatta in casa. Il men\u00f9 \u00e8 molto semplice la cameriera ci ha spiegato tutto il men\u00f9 accuratamente spiegandoci passo per passo e consigliandoci le dosi adatte. Alla fine abbiamo optato tra gli starter piccoli da non riempire troppo, il bollito croquette con salsa di peperoni e cioccolato, amazing; poi abbiamo preso la famosa costata da 800kg di fassona, squisita, carne tenera che si scioglie in bocca accompagnata da patatine hand cut, e fagioli, che dire wow! Poi un'altra cameriera ci ha spiegato i dolci e anche lei ci ha raccomandato di provare la panna cotta al basilico, il latte fritto, il tiramis\u00f9 e la cheesecake; e anche qua siamo rimasti sbalorditi, una qualit\u00e0 che non si pu\u00f2 descrivere non \u00e8 uno scherzo provare per credere!!

        "Review: My friend recommended we go here on a Friday evening as the place was quite new. The menu looked great and its a great location so we were pretty excited about it!Unfortunately, it was incredibly disappointing. The service went from being too overbearing (people literally circling our table trying to find plates to clear and disturbing us every 5 minutes or so) to being completely inept.As for the food itself, the starters we had were tiny and pretty dry. We went for the Costata all'antica beef rib w/garlic and rosemary for our main, which was very good, but I'm pretty sure they gave us the rock salt option. Neither of us could taste garlic or rosemary at all. As for dessert, the waitress misunderstood my friend's order. All good, it happens, but she then blamed my friend for this and it took a good five minutes for her to replace the order. By this point we were both pretty exhausted by the whole experience.All I can say is I'm glad it was 50% off, because I certainly wouldn't have paid full price for such a poor experience. We go to plenty of similar restaurants and this was by far the worst.",

        "Review: My sister and I were fortunate enough to get a table here on a Saturday evening during their soft launch. The restaurant is in a lovely location and the decor and atmosphere is fantastic. We were seated upstairs near the bakery and the smell of fresh dough baking was making our stomachs rumble. Our waiter was amazing in explaining the menu to us and gave us great recommendations. If we could have we would have ordered everything on the menu! We were given complimentary Fassona salami and Fassona Bresola with home made bread, these were so delicious I could have happily just eaten this all day. For starters we had the cheese and tomato \"pissa\" the stracchino cheese was amazing I love buffalo mozzarella but this was better than that. The olive oil they have on the table is a perfect accompaniment to this. We also ordered the prosciutto crudo with aged parmigiano Reggiano. This was good, but after having the Fassona salami this seemed less likeable. We were recommended to have about 600 grams of the beef rib, when they bring the meat to your table it seems fatty, but it all added to the flavour. We were told that the meat is aged for 60 days. My sister likes her meat medium rare so asked for the meat to be cooked to her liking. Luckily there were cuts of meat that were more on the rare side. The flavour of the meat is truly incredible never tried anything so flavourful and melt in the mouth. I even chewed on some of the fat. We ordered the spinach, broccoli and chips as the sides. The greens were disappointing, but the chips were yummy. I had a carafe of an amazing Baralo wine (made especially for Macellaio RC) it was so lovely and perfect with the meal. For dessert we had tiramisu (very disappointing) and panna cotta (refreshing and unusual) for dessert, but to be honest we just got these to try the desserts. The real reason to come here is for their amazing meat, cheese and lovely bread. Skip dessert (this is coming from someone with an extremely sweet tooth). As this is their soft opening some of the staff clearly need more training on the menu, however, they were still friendly and tried to be helpful. Our waiter was amazing, he transported me to the service I had on my holiday in Italy. As for the food... If you love meat and want quality, tasty meat then go here you won't regret it. Prices are reasonable too. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. ",

        "Title: Not uniformly excellent",
        "Review: The arrival of the third, and, arguably, most theatrical branch of Macellaio RC, further cements this district between Tate Modern and Southwark tube as something of a foodie destination. It's accessed through a yard past two other relatively new albeit slightly more modest joints all sharing large cavernous spaces underneath railway arches. Downstairs features a bar, kitchen, and, draped by curtains, a veritable raised altar for the slicing of beef into the signature steaks. Large outlines of cattle highlight the different cuts available. To the side toilets with signage combining the bovine with hieroglyphics to distinguish between the sexes are situated beneath a large Italian inscription extolling the philosophy behind the business. A short receptionist doubles up occasionally as waitress. A waiter explains the various sections on the menu recommending, for our table of three, something from the Ligurian bakery upstairs such as the Italian equivalent of the Nicoise pisaladiere thin cheesy flatbread with tomato or anchovy, or focaccias which can be supplemented by salami or cheese, then a dish or two from the Cicchetti section (although these are a sort of Italian tapas I was surprised to see the likes of oxtail and mash, marsh lamb and foam, although not various cold hams), finally sharing say 750g of the speciality of the house, Fassone steak preserved and aged in salt. As my wife is not a great carnivore we chose ravioli to be shared with our daughter as their main whilst I opted for 500g of steak with chips. Some complimentary focaccia and salami arrived which was so more-ish we chose a flatbread with cheese. This was a unusual as it was excellent, the only drawback being that, on dividing the large pizza-shaped portion, the cheese tended to ooze as much into the table as onto our plates. We were less impressed with croquettes with beef and chocolate which were a bit strange. The chunk of lamb with foam was tasty enough, but odd as a starter. No complaints, however, about the piece de resistance steak, nicely sliced and dramatically served beneath a vast tureen. However the ravioli was disappointing. It was dry and overcooked and was in dire need of a ragu or cheesy sauce. Although there is an extensive wine list including many Italian vintages for connoisseurs, we were surprised to see the concise beer list including, from Germany, St. Stephane's Weissbier and Bamberger Rauchbier, the latter I had not seen since visiting Bamberg as a student in the 1970s. These we chose despite their rather high prices (both around the \u00a37.50 mark) My daughter enjoyed her chocolate cake which she ate whilst we had perfect double espressos.",

He gave recommendations, all of which were well received. The wines are on the pricey side relative to other places within London, but of very high quality! We ordered two starters and then had 700g of steak between two. We ordered chips ( amazing!) and spinach ( so so) as our two sides. The steak was the best I've ever had! Very well cooked and the Rosemary sauce made it even better! The decor/vibe is really good - I think it would be a great place for birthday celebrations as the table downstairs are large and they have also have space outside! Would definitely recommend :) ",
