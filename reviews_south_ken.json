        "Review: It is 18:08 on July 15, 22. I just left the restaurant... least to say worst customer service ever. I went with my daughter for a nice dinner with high expectations of a cosy nice place. Unfortunately we went and stood for at least 3 mins with the manager and staff doing nothing and when my daughter asked if we can sit outside on one of the empty tables. The manager said that he will be with us shortly ( at this time I sat on the side on a sofa, as I am disabled, I can't stand for long time) . The manger showed up rolling his eyes and speaking in a hostile style claiming that he has reservations ( there were no signs of reservations) we only have one hour to finish our dinner ( sarcastic style) . The upleasent experience details can go on and on. In short and as a freshly graduated lawyer who is attentive to details, and After more than 30 years on this country, this is so far the worst discrimination unprofessional experience I ever had!!! It is a shame it is just down the road from where we live.",

        "Review: Was really looking forward to this but was a bit disappointed in the end. A couple of things. The starter one of us ordered was Tartare but it didn\u2019t say that on the menu, did say it for other dishes but not this one. Wouldn\u2019t have been ordered if we had known. Fuller and better description would have been good.Rib Eye steak (Scottish) and I\u2019ve consumed many was overdone and in places tough. Have to say the Fassano Sirloin was lovely as was the asparagus and the Beet and Fennel salad so most of the food was great, but when you lead on steak and then it\u2019s poor then that\u2019s a shame.The waiter did listen to the feedback and comped us dessert which was nice. The bill came to \u00a3228 for two of us which after the experience didn\u2019t seem worth it I\u2019m afraid. One other thing. Female toilet out of service and the male toilet was hanging, obviously no attention paid to it during the evening and expected better from this place.",

        "Review: Not really sure where it started to go wrong with this meal. Perhaps it was how many times we had to ask for bread with our starters (which weren\u2019t very nice). The bread eventually arrived half way through our mains. The waiter was nice but service was slow and seemed to go from \u2018attentive\u2019\u2026.literally the front of house guy constantly trying to put the napkins on our lap to \u2018indifferent\u2019 because we\u2019d dared to chase up our food. The whole atmosphere felt wrong. I literally started to feel like we were being ignored. Tables around us were given limoncello after their meals\u2026not us! Barely an acknowledgment as we left and we paid \u00a3170 for the privilege, that\u2019s without deserts and only 1 glass of wine.My main of fillet steak was ok but the ridiculous amount of salt on everything ruined the taste. My husbands steak seemed small, overcooked and was certainly no better than why we could cook at home. Apparently for some customers they bring the cuts to the table for you to see? Not us. If any of the management or staff at this restaurant ever happen to read this, please remember good customer service should be at the heart of what you do. Treat everyone the same and with respect. Otherwise you\u2019re in the wrong industry.",

Needless to say that the starter was beautiful as well as the meat (just a note for the chef: the meat was perfectly cooked medium rare as we ordered, but the plate was cold so the dish got cold too in a couple of minutes and we actually asked to warm up 4/5 pieces to enjoy the flavour more).We ended the night with a couple of Espresso, a whiskey Oban 14yo and an Amaretto Disaronno.We will come back 100%",

Fantastic cold cuts, the best Fiorentina we have ever had, great wine recommendation, great desserts and (finally!) a really good espresso to end it all with. Absolutely worth every penny. Thank you guys!",

        "Review: We went there to try Florentine Steak which we read about in the internet. In summary, this restaurant is charging like a very posh restaurant without any of its features! The reasons that I gave it three stars instead of one were: very nice waiter who was very kind and helpful and I want to thank him for his kindness and also the food itself was good. However, in this restaurant we paid about \u00a3120 of which over \u00a360 was only for the sides, drinks (we did not order any wine, just lemonade and water) and service. The restaurant is not a very well decorated, posh, elegant one. There was not any live music or anything of kind. So, I do not know why this restaurant should charge so much for simple sides and drinks? Also, it was very hot there and they said they cannot increase the AC speed!!! The lemonade was warm (they brought glass with ice but I expected the lemonade to be cold itself). It seems that the owner has some issues with electricity bills!!! I paid even more in the past for posh restaurant with top service and decoration/music but in this restaurant the service is similar to the likes of Nando's but you are paying over \u00a34 just for a bottle of water and should expect a huge bill for very simple items.I will not come back and would not recommend it.",

        "Review: So glad to write this review for Macellaio in SK and its very professional staff. We decided to go out for dinner at Macellaio last Thursday 3rd of June, it was me and two other friends. Space is not massively big so I suggest booking a table if you want to be sure to find a seat and enjoy your evening. We had booked an inside table and as soon as we arrived we were nicely welcomed by the staff. The atmosphere is very chilling, the scent in the dining room is tasty and the choice and quality of food are relevant. The staff of Macellaio immediately proved to be very courteous and kind. We were served by Federica, who explained the history and concept of the restaurant. Very interesting. We decided to go for a shared plate but I love rare meat and my mate well-done meat. Federica, kindly, advised us of the dishes to order. We had the opportunity to try different types of meat and during the choice of the main dish, we were introduced to Luca who showed us the part of beef that he had selected for us, he has been friendly and prepared regarding his job. The quality of food is amazing, tasty and I will go back there for sure. I would like to say thank you to Federica, Luca and all the staff for their dedication. I was satisfied with my evening, I spent such a lovely time at Macellaio and we will be going back again.",

The sommelier was outstanding in suggesting and guiding us to a perfect red wine choice without being pushy or too wordy. The waiter Federico was looking after our table and explaining to us very passionately the menu and the different cut of the meat. The owner and the whole crew was truly reflecting an Italian spirit and origin, making us feel at home like nowhere.

        "Review: In questa realt\u00e0 italiana di grande successo a Londra, \u00e8 possibile gustare le prelibatezze nostrane, preparate in maniera superba, con una meravigliosa commistione di tradizione (carni a cottura molto lenta, patate arrosto, polenta) e innovazione (affumicatura, grande disponibilit\u00e0 di crudi di carne, panna cotta al basilico). La qualit\u00e0 della carne \u00e8 indiscutibile. L'antipasto \"L'imperiale\", contenente un po' di tutto, \u00e8 un ottimo modo per provare che a Il Macellaio hanno un'offerta davvero prelibata di carni e formaggi, perci\u00f2 lo consiglio vivamente. Tutte le carni servite successivamente, per quanto chiaramente non le abbia provate tutte, sono preparate con grande rispetto e cura, sia per la carne stessa che per il cliente, che viene davvero coccolato dallo staff, mentre si gusta tutto ci\u00f2 che gli viene servito. A finire, ci \u00e8 stata offerta la panna cotta al basilico. Dessert fresco, perfetto per stemperare i sapori dei piatti precedenti e farti uscire dal locale (ancora pi\u00f9) felice. Il conto rispecchia l'alta qualit\u00e0 della cucina nel contesto di uno dei quartieri pi\u00f9 ricchi di Londra, per cui non mi sembra il caso di dargli troppo peso nel giudizio complessivo. Per gli amanti della carne, italiani e non solo, \u00e8 un must.",

        "Review: 3/15 Sunday evening in LondonAs we entered Macellaio, we were greeted with a big welcome by Federico, a smiling server originally from a town near Cinque Terre, Italy. However, Federico was so much more than just our waiter for the evening. Full of charm, great humor and expert attentiveness, he was our master host, our gastronomical guide, our story-teller and entertainer. In fact, it seems the staff there love a bit of theatre: viciously sharp knives are stabbed into tables with a thud, meat is butchered loudly to order and steaks are delivered under silver cloches until presented to guests with a dramatic reveal. Still, the restaurant and its dishes had a true authentic feel, reminding us a lot of our nostalgic travels in Italy. The restaurant generously started us off with some complimentary and fantastic cured bresaola and house-made focaccia. We added to that an order of perfectly paired prosciutto and creamy burrata cheese. Once we found out the soup of the day was a Ribollita, one of our favorites from Tuscany, we ordered that right away. This soup is very popular after the wine harvest is done and autumn is in full swing, made of bread, cannelloni beans, and vegetables. We also ordered a superb house-made potato Gnocchi with Castelmagno cheese fondue. And then the star of the night was the tender and tasty Costata del Macellaio, a 9-week dry-aged Fassona beef rib steak, cut and trimmed right in front of us before going to the kitchen. For dessert, we each ordered digestives: a Limoncello, Montenegro and a Cynar. And even though the free starter and gracious service was already far enough to delight us, Federico still brought us a complimentary tiramisu to celebrate Bailey\u2019s birthday trip. All the food and service was amazing and I would give this place 6 stars on a 5-star rating system. The whole experience was enough to even impress Her Royal Majesty the Queen. :-)",

        "Review: We were there yesterday evening to celebrate my partner's birthday. Everything was going pretty well (apart from the fact I had to ask twice for a highchair, which was already requested when booked the table). After having finished my meal, I went downstairs to the ladies. While i was waiting to get in, sat in front of them (female and make toilets are close), I saw something revolting: a staff member with black uniform, went to the gents, I heard the toilet flush and in seconds he was out. Clearly he had not washed his hands. When we were asked if everything was ok with our meal, I did mention what I saw to her and told her I did not want to review the restaurant without telling them first. The waitress told me she would speak to the manager. To my biggest surprise, when he came to speak to us, he told me the guys working in the kitchen did not use the toilet in the time frame while I was waiting to use the toilet. At that point, I definitely felt insulted, and told him if he did not believe my words (why on earth would a customer make this up?!) he could go and check their internal CCTV system (I noticed there was a camera pointing that corridor). I should mention there was no hot water to wash your hands, which is not acceptable in winter time and in a restaurant that charges these amounts.The meat (900 grams did cost us 66 pounds) was just average, nothing special, and I am afraid the review I read on tripadvisor about the meat being hard was quite right. It's not the softest. Also, the wine is seriously overpriced. A carafe of wine (half a litre) costs us 28 pounds.",

We had a reservation at 8pm, a lady welcomed us in saying we had only 1 hour 30 minutes to eat (the booking said 2 hours, however I don\u2019t feel it is nice to say it as first thing as soon as we entered the restaurant). I informed the team we had 2 hours stated on the booking confirmation. We ordered starters, main and wine. After 5 minutes we received starters, we finished the starters and after maybe 3 minutes we had our Fiorentina ready on the table. In 30 minutes our dinner was over and immediately 2 waiters came to ask for desserts. We still had more than half bottle of the wine ordered (90\u00a3 bottle) to drink and we obviously informed the team that the service was way too fast... definitely not an enjoyable dinner and meat was not as good as usual.Unfortunately we also heard the table next to ours complaining with the manager of something we could have never thought. The butcher cutting the meat went to toilet and left without washing his hands... unacceptable. Moreover we found the restaurant very dusty, same as cutlery and dishes. We never had in many years such a negative experience. ",

In summary, the best beef in Europe in my opinion comes from Great Britain, Ireland and Northern Spain. At \u00a332.50 per person without sides it was expensive and underwhelming.

        "Review: Questo ristorante che si trova nella zona di South Kensington a soli 5 minuti dalla fermata della metro. All arrivo siamo stati accolti da una gentile ragazza e da un fantastico federico, al quale avevamo prenotato il tavolo, che ci ha fatto accomodare nella sala pi\u00f9 intima del locale, facendoci gli onori di casa ci ha anche spiegato per filo e per segno tutto il loro men\u00f9 con le loro punte di diamante. Seguendo molti dei suoi consigli siamo riusciti a mangiare molto bene rimanendo particolarmente colpiti dalle varie tartare di carne, dagli gnocchi fatti in casa e soprattutto dalla costata di fassona piemontese frollata che rimaneva tenerissima e squisita al gusto. Un plauso va fatto a tutti gli altri membri dello staff dal barista ai camerieri passando per i cuochi per averci fatto sentire a casa in quanto essendo tutti italiani sono stati di estrema cortesia e simpatia. Per quanto riguarda il conto bisogna solamente stare attenti a cio che si beve. Posto consigliattissimo se si \u00e8 a Londra per vacanza impossibile non passare a rilassarsi in questo locale.",

When we arrived to the restaurant it was closed - desperately I tried to get in touch with the restaurant or someone but without any success. And thats our story - reserved table on Christmas day with closed restaurant. Thank you so much for the unforgettable experience Macellaio!

Ovvero non viene portato il pane al tavolo neanche a chi consuma la carne , viene servito un piccolo omaggino della casa costituito da 3 fette di salame in croce ma soprattutto 4 pezzettini di focaccia fatta in casa grossa come un unghia. Non sto esagerando, erano grossi veramente come un unghia. ragazzi ma che scherziamo ?

Abbiamo mangiato una tartare ed una fettuccina al rag\u00f9 ( buonissime, fatte in casa) dopo 40 minuti di attesa la cameriera si ricorda di dire che hanno avuto un problema e le nostre tagliate saranno pronte tra due minuti. Dopo un altro quarto d\u2019ora arriva un filetto minuscolo tagliato a fette troppo cotto, a quel punto faccio presente al cameriere che non \u00e8 arrivata una tagliata e lui ha la faccia tosta di dire che non era vero negando l\u2019evidenza ( sono italiana,abbiamo parlato solo in italiano, e la carne la conosco) neanche le scuse per aver dimenticato di passare in cucina il nostro l\u2019ordine.

It was one of these places where the waiter tries to push you into having all of the fancy meat and it made me feel a bit uncomfortable. The pasta was delicious but I had to have something else to eat after as it was so small. We then had a parmesan cheese board, once again nice but SO MUCH PARMESAN...

The meat was tender and juicy but we found the rest of the menu with no character. The bruschetta with lardo was nothing memorable and the chips had probably prepared using an exhausted oil. The wine was ordinary, despite the price. The service overall was poor organised and despite the appearance it seemed to be low professional. The place is always crowded and the booking is highly recommended. Anyway we found this popular address overpriced and overrated. The meat is good but it needs improvement in service, less pretentious and more friendly as I aspected from an informal italian trattoria. ",

The chips were nice, but no good steak sauces sadly...The clanger for me was the egg shell in the tiramisu (which I promptly stopped eating) - rightly, this was removed from the bill, but I would have though a token gesture of some kind would have ensured (as is usually the case in decent restaurants) - sadly not - 160 quid later (for 2) = wish I\u2019d gone to Hawksmoor...Oh and be prepared for the possibly of - raw meat scent frequently wafting past your nasal passages, depending on where you sit.

        "Review: This place is absolutely delicious mainly for meat lovers. It\u2019s the third time we go and every time is an unforgettable experience.We booked the table for the day after by mistake but they let us sit down at the macellaio\u2019s counter since it is was fully booked for the night. It was great to see how the cut the meat how the prepare the fresh meat and we had the chance to meet and spend the evening talking to Ilario. Also Tommaso gave us an amazing Service. We loved the food and it is always a joy being in heaven with a bite.Thank you again!",

Firstly on the grounds of poor customer service and secondly poor value. While the food quality is adequate, the portion sizes are intolerably mean. It took me 20 minutes to get customer service after I was seated in a corner bench and ignored throughout my stay. Now let\u2019s discuss the food. Do not try the rump. The portion size once served could not have been any more than 80 grams. I just wished I took a photo to show how mean the portion size was. While I understand margins are slim in the restaurant trade this is a joke ! With increasing competition this restaurant needs to take note. Poor service and mean portion sizes will not be tolerated and ultimately will turn all customers away.",

The waiter Tommaso explained all the cuts and made recommendations based on our tastes. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to eat a Starter so we went straight for the main Course. One Fillet medium rare minimum size and one Rib steak medium rare. One portion of fries and a raw red cabbage salad. Plus a tomato and onion salad not on the menu. No sauces. They believe you should eat the steaks \u201cbare\u201d. They even dissuade you from ordering mustard. Happy to bring it but say you won\u2019t taste the flavour of the meat. Presentation was simple. The steaks were divine. We will be returning. No more mediocre steaks elsewhere. Wines by the glass excellent. A delightful Prosecco. Desserts are truly delicious and made on the premises. One beautiful creamy cheesecake and a custard type ice cream. Gorgeous. Plus 2 glasses of excellent Dessert wine. Tiramisu was highly recommended but that\u2019s for next time. Espresso to finish.

What a unique restaurant with sides of meat hanging in the front window and the option of ordering different cuts of beef. Among the many delicious entree items that we ordered were the hangar steak, lamb and 700 gram portions of the Costata del Macellaio and Fiore del Macellaio.

Abbiamo scelto degli antipasti misti di crostino con lardo, tartare accompagnati con del buon pane e focaccine. In seguito, mentre i miei due colleghi hanno optato per un filetto con rucola e scaglie di parmigiano, io mi sono avventata in una bistecca di agnello davvero squisita soprattutto perch\u00e9 cotta nel miglior modo e accompagnata da una salsa di melanzana affumicata, yogurt e menta che mi ricordava il babaganoush ma era molto pi\u00f9 leggera e si sposava perfettamente con la carne. Come contorno abbiamo ordinato delle patatine fritte con la buccia e un insalata di finocchio e arancia. Uno dei miei colleghi ha anche ordinato un dolce a base di panna cotta e essenza di basilico che aveva un sapore davvero fresco e piacevole!

My friends were happy enough with their heart but my marrow was sublime: beautifully cooked bones, topped with beef tartare and a salad of onions and herbs that cut the richness beautifully. One friend opted for the calf's liver as a main, which she very much enjoyed but the rest of us shared a piece of the Costata (800g between three of us). The meat was succulent, marbled with melted fat, well rested and sprinkled with salt that brought out the rich, umami flavour. As sides we had savoy cabbage, chips and a delicious nutmeg spiced mashed potato. The waiter, who was very charming and helpful, recommended a truly gorgeous wine (see photo) which I have subsequently bought a case of, so good was it. Pudding was a little bit of a downer for me (Frito leche) but my friends loved their chocolate icecream. There are lots of nice restaurants in this area but you should definitely choose to visit this one.",

Molto buono anche il resto dalla vellutata di zucca con porri alle penne al rag\u00f9 e per finire un tiramis\u00f9 davvero delizioso.

It was very distracting.The food and the staff are both very good. Used the online service to book a table which was fine with just a phone call the day before to confirm. My wife and daughter some normal things of the menu which were very tasty and good value I thought. I opted for one of there special rib steaks which was very tasty but was told that the smallest they would cut would be 600grams that turned out to be 700grams when cut. That made it quite expensive for one I thought so my suggestion would definitely be to share a slightly larger one between 2 as others were doing. That being said it was tasty and I don't regret it.",

Dry Aged Beef from the North of Italy, masterfully handled by the gentleman working behind the counter.....Steak tar tar, followed by grilled dry aged rib eye, accoutrements, and dessert to follow!Loved the atmosphere even though we were crammed into a high top counter in the corner(last table available) The entire cast made us feel welcome.....will visit again next time in London!",

Since we has a reservation we were seated straight away (I had a lovely chat with the hostess, who had lived in Barcelona for a bit).The tatare was superb and my boyfriend particularly enjoyed the testicles. The fillet was great and we loved that it was shown to us before it was even cooked. I had the gnocchi and it was really tasty.The service was excellent and we felt really spoilt by Federico and Nicolas who never let our wine glasses go empty.Keep up the good work!

It\u2019s quirky, for example there\u2019s a comfy sofa outside and there\u2019s a nicely displayed meat counter with the various cuts.The food was good, cooked to our liking. However, this is not a cheap place \u2013 and we did not expect it to be cheap. But this brings me to my only criticism of the place. When we arrived, before being taken to our table we were reminded that the restaurant operates a 2-hour turnaround for tables. At a restaurant that, by all accounts, charges around the \u00a3100/head for a meal with wine, we expected to have a bit more luxury with time. Prior to arrival we\u2019d planned on staying on to have desert wines but decided to eat up and move along to a wine bar next door. Had we known this we would probably not have booked here. Although communicated very politely, the introduction made us feel that we needed to order, eat and vacate. If I\u2019m not mistaken, this place started as a single restaurant but has rapidly expanded into a mini chain, and is clearly doing well. I wonder if this has resulted in a more corporate approach, with practices like the above. As it shifts to this model it risks becoming another Gaucho Grill.",

We ordered their top meat, the tbone. It is good but i have tasted much better in several other places.

Recently I have been there again. Last time I was a bit in a rush and asked for a quick place if available.... reply : No problem at all, give me 5 min.......those 5 min became almost 40 mindoesn't matter ! at least the girl was nice and gentle.... I can understand she was trying to catch some money for the company and find me a seat, but I did asked few times : if you haven't got a place in short time doesn't matter just let me know..............going ahead ..... after finally have a seat I place my order as quick as possible ....all good as always apart that I did receive first food and only after my wine ..........and finally the main reason of this not positive review........next to my table were sitting a table of 3, italians as me and I unfortunately overheard as follow :.... all 3 of them into mozzarella business, so they decided to try mozzarella di buffala into the menu'. When mozarella arrived they were quite disappointed. Just to begin you never serve a buffala's mozzarella cold (this was the case). Usually you put this kind of mozzarella in warm water few miinutes before serve it in order to realize all the flavour and juice into it. When arrived manager they question him and try to have more information about the product they were served with. Manager at the beginning declared he didn't know exactly where from the mozzarella come (was the best reply considering what happen after), so he added was made locally..... italian buffalo's mozzarella made in UK ??? so he begin to show of his very low culturale level into his field. Firstly telling better UK made cause where are done in Italy the territory is contaminated so mozzarellas aren't good (the 3 seating of course not happy to hear that but they let the young ignorant manager go ahead)..... young manager went ahead with his ignorance show of. The 3 customers congratulate him for all the rest of dinner but politly addressed how awful was the mozzarella. The young manager first left with a face mimic that deserved a straight punch on his nose. Not happy about that, he dare even to come back and rudely said to customer to enjoy them mozzarella........Now since a while I spotted myself as quality and customer service went slighty down, especially in different branches. This time it was really too much not to review what I withness myself.Now mr. Roberto Costa, I have been your customer since a while and I saw youngster beginning as waiters and be rewarded for them hard job with new position as managers.Mr. Costa please keep an eye and don't let some ignorant spoil your and others hard work be spoiled !I do love Macellaio and many italians does as well I'm sure and not only, maybe you can trick English people or whatever clients can come from but considering you got many italians clients your stuff should be much more carefull and informed about what they sell and don't take the piss of well informed clients.KEEP IT SIMPLE !

        "Review: What I'm most annoyed about.. is that I haven't been before :)The concept is as stated in other reviews.. a butcher with a restaurant attached. It's not fancy dining but that's fine because for 3 courses and a drink each, including service it was \u00a3136 is not unreasonable... especially if you've seen some of the other places I've been to. I liked the informal nature, the quirky Italian service (which I thought was very good and attentive) and the overall vibe. Ultimately could I see myself going again or recommending it and the answer to both is YES.All the waiting staff were friendly and attentive and super helpful at explaining and helping us choose the right cuts and meats.To avoid chewy steaks order fillet and go with what the chef recommends.I'll leave you with some piccys. It was all delicious and cant wait to go back again with friends. ",

        "Review: We had a dreadful experience at this restaurant. Everything from the service to the overpriced meat to the pasta and the wine was a disaster. The menu is dishonest by omission. Only after you have decided to order are you told that there is a weight minimum for the beef (not on the menu). When the server suggested a carafe of wine that goes well with the meat, it turns out that the 34 GBP price is for a half carafe rather than the misleading 'carafe' from the menu (quantities also not on the menu). The simple pasta we ordered to share as a starter arrived with barely a moist coat of sauce (we do understand how pasta is served in Europe) and we had to ask 4 times for a server to bring us some grated cheese, while the pasta grew cold on the table and 2 servers stood chatting nearby. We should have paid for the pasta and walked out then and there. The 58GPB piece of meat was delivered \"medium rare,\" which in this restaurant means close to raw, and it arrived already sliced up so we couldn't send it back for another minute or two in the oven. A bad experience from start to finish. Caveat emptor.",

        "Review: Servizio pessimo in quanto la cameriera faceva trasparire poca voglia di essere li in quel momento e poco incline a suggerire la giusta scelta per me e la mia ragazza. in poche parole oltre a portare i piatti a tavola bisogna essere cortesi, saper indirizzare il cliente alla scelta dei piatti e non far trasparire sufficienza agli occhi. Detto questo le tagliatelle erano senza sapore, la trippa non amalgamata nella sua salsa e la carne .... bhe'.. bocciata!Non lo consiglio",

We sat near the butcher counter so we could see what was going on. The staff were lovely and looked after us beautifully telling us about the meat and helping us with our choice of steak even advising us what we were going to have would have been to much for 3 of us to share.........they were completely right and for that reason alone I would recommend the restaurant. The 4th person in our group chose a fillet steak and was delighted saying it was the best she\u2019d had, the rest of us felt exactly the same about out T-bone and rib eye. Loved the way the knives were stuck in the table and the way the steak was presented with the domes over the meat. Spotted the offal section and decided to try that as well All in all a fantastic evening thank you very much.",

Il Personale quasi tutto italiano molto gentile ci porta un menu a forma di giornale con buona selezione di primi e soprattutto di secondi di carne. Ci viene proposta l'offerta del giorno a base di tartufo che non accettiamo. Selezioniamo due piatti di carne ben cucinata che ci viene servita su piastra di ardesia e i coltelli ci vengono piantati nel tavolo con effetto scenografico. Entrambe le scelte sono ben cucinate e la carne \u00e8 di qualit\u00e0. Conto abbastanza alto ma nella media dei ristoranti di Londra.

We went for some starters and then for a solid 1kg of T-bone steak (as we were three persons). The steak was an ace, especially when you have in mind that we asked for medium-rare (but French medium-rare). The wine selections of Italian wines was also pleasing and we manage to couple the seam with an excellent Sicilian Ciro Reserva....

        "Review: It's all about expectations and, clearly, my expectations of this place were higher than the result of our visit. I was thinking more \"steakhouse\" and less \"retail shop that serves steak.\" There were three of us and we had a reservation for 7 pm on a Monday night. When we arrived, the host made sure we understood that the table had to be vacated by 9 pm and this would have been no problem at all if the service had been better. As it was, we had to ask for every single thing- can we get a menu? - do we have a waiter? - can we order? - can we order dessert? The busboy, who mostly spoke Italian, was only slightly helpful. The waiter seemed more focused on people he appeared to know or had seen before because he sure wasn't interested in us. As for the food, the steak is sold by weight, with a minimum (I think) of one kilo. So, like most other diners, the three of us split a large piece of beef. We asked for it medium rare, but it was really rare. Tasty, but rare. And the dull knives were little help at all in cutting it. On the other hand, the sides were just servings for one person. The French fries were good, as were the cannellini beans, and the spinach, but they were not for sharing and, in the end, we were still hungry. The tiramisu for dessert was probably the best thing we ate. The entire evening, the waiter never came by to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything so, once again, we had to flag down the busboy to ask for the bill - because it was getting close to our 9:00 deadline. Nearly two hours for three of us to eat a little bit of food! Interestingly, the place emptied out between 8:30-9:00, but then was full again as we left at 9:00 - on a Monday night! (There were probably 12-15 tables, plus some more downstairs near the bathrooms.) In our opinion, this place is not worth the price.",

Not the normal stuffy restaurant in this neck of the woods, but very friendly and relaxed atmosphere. As you enter the restaurant it looks a bit and smells like a butchers, with meat hanging on hooks. We were led to a private room downstairs which I was glad about, as for me personally the raw meat hanging was a bit off putting, definitely not a place for vegans or vegetarians.The food was plentiful and great quality, it just kept coming and coming, the cheese and wine was also superb.",

They offered to redo the steak and I sent it back and received a thicker cut which was good but it was cold and raw in the middle. I didn't send it back a second time. The pasta sides we ordered were just okay. The steak was flavorless and the meal seemed overpriced for what it was. If I go back I will have to try the aged steaks instead.

And for this price I pretend a good service, when we ordered wine (extremely overpriced,it was 50\u00a3a bottle that we pay 8\u20ac back home) it was taking 20 minutes to arrive, we asked for 4 still water and 15 minutes after it arrived 1still and 1 sparkling, we asked for prosecco we got really hot gasses just out the dishwasher and the actual bottle arrived when the dessert was not only finished but they cleaned the table already...So in the end 83\u00a3each it's absolutely not worthed considering that I had to stop for food on the way home because 1 menu was to divide between 4 people (1fiorentina/tbone was to divide between 8 people)",

The staff is polite and courteous, the newly appointed manager is ready to help you to feel at home and, most importantly, the food is fantastic!I did not take any picture...as I was too intent in enjoying the food but I can assure you that I had a great steak whilst my wife enjoyed a tasty ham platter with burrata. We will definitely mark this on our food map!",

Non abbiamo l\u2019abitudine di andare in ristoranti italiani all\u2019estero ma le recensioni sembravano ottime! Abbiamo ordinato bruschette con il lardo di colonnata con miele e noci e fagioli cannellini per antipasto.. ovviamente abbiamo fatto il bis delle bruschette! Superlative!Ci siamo lasciati consigliare sul tipo di carne ed abbiamo scelto la costata .. tenerissima e gustosa! Abbiamo anche assaggiato il prosciutto crudo Sant\u2019Ilario di Parma...una favolosa bresaola ed un carpaccio di fassona memorabile! Mangiamo spesso carne.. in Italia e all\u2019estero e quella del Macellaio \u00e8 nella top five! Tra l\u2019altro abbiamo trovato la nostra amatissima acqua Ferrarelle ( un miraggio per italiani frizzodipendenti abituati alle bollicine naturali senza additivi!) e dulcis in fundo... un tiramis\u00f9 con vero mascarpone!Il costo... in linea con la qualit\u00e0!Il personale, italiano, gentile ed accogliente; il macellaio Fabio: un vero artista!!!",

        "Review: We visited this restaurant because it was recommended as a great place for steaks. Unfortunately, neither me nor my husband were impressed. I have ordered a medium cooked fillet and actually they brought medium well, therefore it was quite dry. My husband's steak was really thin and also extremely fatty, so half of the portion was left in the plate as it was only fat. Just an observation: really poor dessert menu as for Italian restaurant.Despite this we enjoyed the starters: beef tartare with gorgonzola and pasta with fassona ragu. Overall, there are so much better places for steak lovers.",

        "Review: An interesting place, with its own \u201cbutchery\u201d at the entrance with some fantastic looking beef. We were there on a very hot evening. They couldn\u2019t find our booking, even though it was confirmed but nevertheless, we got a high table near the \u201cbutcher\u201d, sitting on high stools, which were not very comfortable. The starters were a mixed bunch, but particularly disappointing, given the price, was the steak tartare. It was nice and fresh but lacked flavour and probably needed more seasoning. The rib of steak main course was cooked perfectly and very enjoyable. There is a pretty good wine list, but I was surprised that the red wine brought to us had not been chilled and was very warm. It was so warm that I am sure it had not been kept in a wine fridge at all. Service was good and friendly.",

The tables are butcher block and the waitress comes out and stabs the table with your steak knife just before your steak arrives. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and told me all about how the cows are raised in Northern Italy. You must order everything a la carte so it can get a little expensive. To me, it was worth it! You might miss the restaurant when you are walking by because it looks like a butcher shop. DO NOT hesitate to eat here if you love great steak!",

Either way, I've walked by it 100 times. It's hard to see what the restaurant is like from the sidewalk; the front room is the retail meat shop. But it's worth going in if you enjoy beef. I had the meatballs app, which actually was interesting but just ok (I wish there had been more sauce, it seemed good and had flakes of chocolate). But the carpaccio was fantastic (unusally thick slices) and the rump roast with the gorgonzola and walnut on the side...Wow, that cheese was more like cheese-butter!! Not a huge portion but very very tasty, and reasonably priced (other cuts, ordered by the size, cost $$). Even the chianti was great. Best of all was all the info and background on their special beef -- and the very detailed, multi-step drying process -- from the waiter, Mauro. A young man, he is very new but was helpful and knew all about the special beef. I will have to return!",

Since it's a busy weekend there wasn't a regular table, but there was a little hidden, private single table directly across from the meat cooler and prep station where one can watch all-things-meat being created. A simple dinner of wine, a starter and some beef was my focus - and relaxing service. I was not disappointed.The prosciutto and burrata were amazing, as was the generous 621gm costata - done very rare. A Barolo to pair with the wonderfully Italian meat was Mauro's suggestion - and paired perfectly.

Once the steak did arrive the order was wrong which we didn't mind as didn't want to make a fuss. The base steak (sirloin, rump and ribeye) were cut too thin.

All of it looked and am sure is superb-I had the liver to start which was so delicious I ordered another portion. To follow a filet steak cooked to perfection I am not going to tell you in what style my taste buds directed me but it's just the way the Chef(s) prepared it. I also had chunky chips and spinach with garlic. No desert because I had mine earlier in the day.Now to the crew-Paola (The Best) in a long time runs the ship with precision, Ratona and Mauro assisted and were ever so attentive. I cannot forget Patrizia and Ilaria as they were meters and greeters and it was great to be welcomed with such style. Although I never met Francesco and Daniel as they were in charge of the bar I am sure if I wanted wine they would have offered useful advice.Finally, although this is fine dining it is not an arm and leg job it is just perfect.Thank you I will return and hope they remember me!

I called on Thursday to book a table, hence no problems concerning the reservation. We ordered a really delicious battuta - I must say I ordered it because I saw how they treated raw meat, and I already tried their meat which is really good quality. Then we had a costata that we shared. We also had a bottle of red Merlot (okay; but not the best I ever had), water and some bread (focaccia was fantastic). Can\u2019t say it was a cheap dinner but the meat is extremely good, service is friendly and polite and overall we had a very nice dinner.",

        "Review: We came here on a Weekend as a party of 4, managed to book a table fine and without any issues. Arrived at our booking time, we were seated straight away on a little table upstairs. Our Waiter was friendly but a little off, we dont think he was too fond of us. We tried to order a particular bottle of Red, Waiter returned saying the one we ordered was out of stock but tried to offer us several pricier alternatives (about \u00a312 - 15 more expensive that the one we originally chose). We didn't want to spend that much on Wine so it was a little tricky trying to find a nice bottle within the price range we were trying to keep to.We eventually found a different bottle of Red and ordered some water for the table too, Wine arrived in good time. The water never arrived and we had to ask 3 times until it eventually arrived.We ordered some Carpaccio to start with Bread & Oil which was lovely, we ordered our mains one of the party tried to order a steak medium/well which didn't go down too well with the waiter and he shot him a look of death! The Waiter convinced the person in our party to settle with Medium as opposed to Medium/Well which he actually preferred. The service was okay I wouldn't say it was particularly friendly or welcoming, we didn't feel too comfortable asking the waiter for advice or getting his attention to order as we didn't get a great vibe from him unfortunately.Meal was a good one but a little pricey! We were also charged \u00a323 service charge which is a pet hate of mine as it is always so awkward to ask for it to be removed. I think \u00a323 to serve a table of 4 is also a extreme price wise. We would of happily left a tip as we always do but I think this is a little expensive for the service we received.",

Queste sono solitamente le quantit\u00e0 degli \u00ab\u00a0amuse-bouches\u00a0\u00bb.Abbiamo poi gustato un ottimo fegato su pure di cipolle arrostite come antipasto, due primi, ravioli al tocco e trenette al pesto genovese. I primi piatti erano molto buoni, ottimi il rag\u00f9 di Fassona ed il pesto con i tipici fagiolini e patate, peccato solo che non abbiano usato acqua salata per cuocere la pasta e quella piccola mancanza di sapidit\u00e0 non mi permette di dire che fossero eccellenti.Ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato superlativo \u00e8 l\u2019hanger steak! Un piatto senza dubbio perfetto, dalla concezione, alla preparazione, alla presentazione, alla degustazione.Molto buona anche la fresca insalatina di finocchi profumati all\u2019arancia.La piccola torta di mele non ha entusiasmato, forse accompagnata da una crema liquida o altro dress avrebbe pi\u00f9 appeal.Buona la carta dei vini. Eccellente il caff\u00e8! Buon rapporto qualit\u00e0 / prezzo.\u00c8 sicuramente un ottimo ristorante dove torneremo e che consigliamo.",

Maybe British people can find Italian ways rude in some ways, but for me it only adds to the experience, feels very homie and at the same time high class. People complaining about smells - didn't feel any, except good aroma of good meat :) And, well, look at the name.. Interior is great, wine was excellent and served with appropriate glasses.

        "Review: This is a recent find for us... but have already been twice this week!It is all about the meat - you can even have testicles if you feel like it - we declined! Probably not s good place to bring your Vegan friends to - although the spinach and mash potatoes were delicious! It was the hint of nutmeg in the potatoes that made them so morish! Service is really friendly and efficient and the host treats you like a long lost friend.I cannot resist the Rump with gorgonzola and walnuts - but the smoked Hanger Steak is very mouthwatering!!It is all a bit of a show... steak knives thrust into the table in front of you and the glass dome lifted of the steak to release the delicious smell of smoke!If you have enough room.. the Tiramisu is irresistible!",

Fantastic helpful and friendly staff, great food (mostly meat and a few pasta dishes) and a superb wine list. The steak tartare was the best I have EVER had!!

Noi avevamo prenotato e arrivando 10 minuti prima la ragazza ci ha chiesto se nell\u2019attesa poteva offrirci da bere, forse ho capito male l\u2019offerta visto che lo spritz \u00e8 stato messo in conto!

However the service in this restaurant is good. The staff were friendly and helpful. No complaints there.The food however was average or even below average. I was hoping for a very savoury matured meat taste when I ordered the 600 grams of ribeye steak. First of all, there was a huge chunk of rib bone that took up at least a third of the meat weight. Then there is a think skin too that cannot be eaten. So I think out of the 600 grams only about 300 grams are actually edible. The taste was so bland. The wine selection was good though. Oh also I had the beef tartar on bone marrow. Now that one was excellent. ",

This is the perfect mix that has pampered us culinaryly throughout the evening, relying on the knowledge and experience of Andrea who has always been able to give the right advice at the right course. It also has cons, the place is not particularly spacious, always convenient to book a few days in advance.",

Had I not noticed, my evening could have ended a lot worse...however, the rest of the evening and food made up for it - so hence the 4 star ratingCame here with a friend on a cold December night after a long day at work. Left with a full belly and a big smile on my face. My friend ended up getting stuck at work and so was very late for meeting me but the staff didn't make me feel uncomfortable and let me enjoy my gin until she came.We shared the T-Bone steak (800g) and I asked for it Medium Well (no blood) I think the poor waiter nearly died at my request but he handled it graciously and guided us so that we didn't butcher (pardon the pun) the flavour of the meatMy friend is really into wine and due to so much choice, the waiter helped us choose a respectable but rather delicious red (and I don't even like wine!)Nice wee place if you're into meat or even for a (not cheap) date night!",

        "Title: OK but not fantastic",
        "Review: Very busy and crowded. Food is ok, but nothing special. The bread is less than average. Stakes are big but you pay per 100 grams for a minimum of 500 g. Good to share. Also they are not seasoned. Stake tartar is served with no chopped onions, egg yoke or capers, and it is not seasoned which seams to be the trend of this restaurant. You could say this is the \"Italian way\" but Stake Tartar is not Italian anyway. It is not served with Wostershire sauce or Tabasco either. In conclusion, although the meat is good quality, it is bland in taste. It is somewhat primitive to consume raw meat without seasoning. Garnishes also lack imagination or diversity. Staff is generally friendly, but forgetful, as they are very busy. The place has that overwhelming feeling of a factory for money of the \"I need this table in 1,5 hour max\" type, rather than a nice, relaxing restaurant. When booking, ask for a table upstairs, downstairs is completely claustrophobic and unpleasant small room with an extremely noisy, buzzing fridge full of meat. It is ok to go once, but with so many restaurants in London i don't think we'd be braking our legs to go back. ",

        "Review: These are very special cows: Fasano from Piemonte. Double layers of muscle (and much less fat) which makes for VERY tasty eating and much healthier. I would highly recommend the Bistecca Fiorentina (T-Bone), and to start, the steak tartare with gorgonzola. Don't bother with the chips (French Fries). Tremendous Italian wine list, if very fully priced. Tables are too small and cluttered. Our service was not knowledgeable or attentive until the waitress took over (see photo). She was fantastic. The manager was also very charming and proudly showed us his new wine cellar in the basement.Have been here at least 10 times and will definitely keep coming. It's the go-to place for red meat in London. Very honest and real.",

Every time i came there the meat was perfectly cooked and Francesco usually came out the kitchen to speak to the clients and see that everything went properly.

Moderno ma non troppo freddo, con la giusta italianit\u00e0 non pacchiana.Unica pecca: il tavolo nella sala al piano sopra \u00e8 abbastanza piccola e ci si sente un p\u00f2 stretti (il locale era pieno), non ho visto la sala al piano inferiore ma copre un buon numero di coperti.Ci torner\u00f2 sicuramente e prover\u00f2 senz'altro anche gli altri due ristoranti della catena.",

Unfortunately the service is not good enough, as you pay something (a little bit overpriced in our opinion) you expect as well a good service that we haven't received. The wine arrived after the starter was already on the table (15 min after we have actually ordered it). Secondly, the meat as a main course has arrived cold, this is something that's not possible to happen. Nevertheless at least the quality of the meat was good. Coming as side dishes the potatoes arrived a few minutes after the meat... The only good thing we actually loved was the dessert, apparently all of them were homemade and delicious.

Included on the menu are three Tartare dishes which was ideal for us. We tried the beef Tartare which was simply presented in olive oil. My son described this as \"too delicious\" which made the whole visit worthwhile. The rump steak which followed was also excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.Service was great too. It took a while for the steaks to come out so we were offered a complimentary plate of cold meats and our service charge was waived. Sometimes things don't go perfectly and it's a sign of great service when you don't have to complain to have that recognised.If you like meat you should try Macellaio RC. We certainly hope to return.

This was remedied to be fair.The menu had lots of interesting, different dishes, which included testicles, pigeon and rabbit. Sadly the waiting staff didn't inform us of the things which were no longer available when we arrived so we waisted a bit of time choosing only to be told our choices were unavailable. Disappointing. We also felt a bit pushed by the waitress who seemed intent on us sharing some meat for the entire table. We made our own choices however, and were very pleased with the food. The staff were surly, unfriendly and gave the general impression that they hated us, we eventually asked to speak to the manager. Walter \"the manager\" saved the day. He managed to turn things around and spent time listening to our complaints. He was very kind and treated us like royalty for the rest of the evening. Ultimately we had a great meal with great service from him. We would try this place again as the chef is obviously very talented. Walter assured us that the staff would have some more training in customer service. Give it a try.",

Siamo 3 ordiniamo 3 tartare di fassona con gorgonzola squagliata sopra. Deliziosa, poi la cameriera ci consiglia una fracosta, buona, peccato che per 2, tolto osso e grasso c'era veramente poca ciccia, quindi noi proseguiamo con una classica T-Bone. Tutto delizioso, buona anche la carta dei vini, per essere a Londra c'era una buona scelta a prezzi discreti.

        "Review: Ce restaurant italien sympathique se situe dans l'agr\u00e9able quartier de South Kensigton. C'est l\u00e0 son principal attrait, mais aussi en partie s\u00fbrement l'explication de ses prix tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s.Le concept est simple : cuisine italienne... et \u00e9normes pi\u00e8ces de boeuf ! C'est plein comme un oeuf et il faut vraiment penser \u00e0 r\u00e9server. En revanche, la salle est horriblement bruyante (on se croirait dans un bar \u00e0 Tapas de Barcelone, c'est dire !)Bref, pour moi : les p\u00e2tes au basilic \u00e9taient parfaites, les frites fa\u00e7on potatoes splendides (et peu grasses). Quant \u00e0 la \"super viande\", je ne l'ai pas trouv\u00e9e si g\u00e9niale (il est vrai que j'ai un bon boucher au quotidien) et surtout tr\u00e8s mal d\u00e9coup\u00e9e !Vin correct (\u00e0 prix exhorbitant, of course). Pas le top, mais correct (si on n'est pas celui qui paye l'addition, bien s\u00fbr) !",

        "Review: So funny because I was greeted with the question \"have you a booking?\" Even though there were only four other people dining at the time! As it happens I did have a booking and I was taken to the back area to a simple table with straw mat type chairs. Wine bottles on shelves and they have a chandelier made of bottles. Also on the wall was an award for best Italian in Kensington. I was with my daughter and we ordered soft drinks, steaks, mashed potatoes and french fries. They show you your cut of meat before they cook it to make sure it meets your approval. We had to ask them to hurry up because we waited quite a while, considering there were only six customers. They served the bread and olive oil just as our meal was delivered. My mashed potatoes were good, my daughter enjoyed her fries and we both really enjoyed our steaks! \u00a355 for lunch for two, no starters or desserts. ",

        "Title: Delicious beef - segregated seating",
        "Review: The restaurant was recommended by very friendly staff at a wine store nearby. The restaurant's front staff were very pleasant and accommodating when booking the reservation (stating that it would be a 2 hour seating) and when greeting us. We were seated in the front section of the restaurant (see comments below). Wait staff was efficient if not a bit formal/stiff. To start we selected a starter, appetizer and pasta dish from the multi-course menu -- oddly we were served all three selections at the same time creating a feeling we were being rushed out of the restaurant. The beef tartare was excellent ( with a splash of the stunningly delicious EVO that was placed table side) and a grind of salt, and the penne (perfectly al dente) in pomodoro sauce with basil was simple but delicious. The bollito croquettes were a disappointment - tasteless boiled beef meatballs in a fried crust with a scant dab of sauce anchoring the three small croquettes to the slate plate - definitely do not recommend. In regard to the entrees, my partner had the rabbit ( apparently a new item on the menu with an herbed yogurt sauce) which I was told was quite good. I had a 230 gm fillet of beef, medium rare, which was cut by the butcher in the front of the shop and prepared perfectly. Additional sides included crispy roasted potatoes and green beans, both deliciously prepared. The wine list is not inexpensive but there was a delicious Maremma region wine (for about 45 pounds) that was delicious and paired quite well with the meal. The chocolate truffle dessert (with candied citrus and cocoa powder) was delicious and the aged grappa that we had to accompany it was very smooth. Overall the food and wine experience was very pleasant. However, as a gay couple there were two disconcerting issues with the dining experience which for me dissuades me from highly recommending this restaurant. The first was presenting all the pre-entree courses (starter, appetizer and pasta) at one time which seemed to rush the meal (creating a feeling that the restaurant was trying to get us out asap). Also during the two hours we were there, there was pretty strict segregation of same sex couples to the front of the restaurant and mixed couples to the back dining room. When I questioned the hostess about this she assured us that it was coincidental .... but it seemed to be quite prevalent through the evening seating. If others have had the same experience then I would discourage gay couples (and others who support equality) from supporting this restaurant.",

        "Review: We arrived a bit in late, in most of London's restaurants when that happens, especially after half an hour, they just give your table, that doesn't happen to us and was a good first impression. We were 4, firstly the waitress who was serving us was the blonde one with glasses, a classic waitress with a fake smile who tries to sell you more as is possible, obviously it's good for the restaurant's business, but isn't when a customer can really see that because a good restaurant doesn't need this sad attitude and the table next us was saying the same about her service. Fortunately then another waitress was taking care of us, she was just incredible so attentive, patient and organized and with a fluent english (instead of the other one) so thank you Patricia (?) if this is your name! The food was so good, unfortunately they were reorganizing the wine list, but anyway we had a lovely red wine. We loved the Carpaccio, Fiorentina and more, everything was so good and arrived very quick but without giving us the pressure for leaving. We end with a lovely Tiramisu and Afogato, also we get some liqueurs. The bill was fair enough for what we had and for the nice service, we obviously will be back (but with Patricia serving us) thanks a lot! ",

To remedy the our underestimated order, we got a few more portions of french fries and spinach. It needs to be said that both of these sides are extremely small (spinach was one mouthful on a plate) and outrageously priced. The wine selection was also confusing. Instead of offering cheap, mid-range and expensive wines - they only offered mid-range and extremely expensive..

        "Review: Came in for dinner and had very high expectations after reading the reviews.My boyfriend and I decided I have the rib eye as I was said to be dried aged and it was recommend on the menu to have 600g but the waitress said that for two 700g would be better. They came and showed us the steak that was mean for us, it had no marbling at all and looked extremely pink and moist for a dried aged steak. When it came, it had no flavour whatsoever, was over cooked, chewy and full of condensation from the silver dome. Sides were also bland and flavourless, including te chips!! And we were not offered any condiments.And it was unfortunate that there was no sommelier around to explain the very complex wine menu. But all in all, if you like real steaks there are so many better restaurant in London to go for. ",

        "Review: \u00cdbamos toda la familia con mis tres hijos de 8, 5 y 3 a\u00f1os. Aunque no ten\u00edamos reserva y el local estaba muy concurrido nos hicieron hueco en una mesa alta de la entrada (mejor para no molestar en el comedor...). La pasta fresca, acertamos con los ravioli de rag\u00fa, los tagliatele y el otro plato de pasta normales; buen\u00edsimo el steak tartar; de postre, 5 pounds por un helado de vainilla me parece excesivo; el chocolate cake muy rico (de esos brownies que sirven calentitos), y el blonze inglese demasiado dulce. En cualquier caso, creo que acertamos ya que nos trataron genial y fueron muy amables con los ni\u00f1os que estuvieron bastante \"movidos\". La carne fresca ten\u00eda muy buena pinta pero est\u00e1 claro que la cuenta hubiera sido desorbitada. De este modo, incluyendo dos cervezas y agua, fueron aprox unas 80 pounds, que para lo que es Londres y un local como este, pues no est\u00e1 mal (siendo cinco). Recomiendo el sitio por la proximidad a los museos de Ciencias e Historia Natural que deben visitarse si vas con ni\u00f1os a Londres.",

        "Review: We arrived at 20:30 and the young manager welcomed us and first thing he said that we needed to free the table for 22:30 as they had other bookings.......I found this very rude in particular if you consider that at 22:15 the restaurant was empty!!!!! Not sure it's a strategy to show that the place is very busy...............We ordered some starters and then a \"fiorentina\" as a main and some sides.The fiorentina was good the rest was very bad including the bread basket (we found pieces of bread probably from other tables emptied in our basket.....). The sides were expensive and the portions very very small. Roast potatoes not good at all.Overall the service wasn't good. We mentioned to the waitress that we found a broken piece of bread in the basket and she was very ashamed and told his boss who didn't even come to speak to us to apologize........the staff is very young and you notice this........A real pity as a couple of years ago when it was called \"MAXELA\" I found the restaurant quite good. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant!And after all this the bill................extremely expensive not justified AT ALL.Sorry",

Cool decor but food was SO disappointing (not just the meat, the sides as well) and this was by far our worst meal in London, even though it was one of the pricier ones.

The restaurant was busy and service seemed to be a little slow. We had a selection of beef carpaccio with parmesan shavings and rocket to start, followed by steak tartare (quite a small portion, but taste was second to none), orecchia d'elefante (BIG portion and delicious), scaloppine (3 of them, regular size), coda alla vaccinara (perfectly cooked) and one more dish - all plates were wiped clean, so we definitely all VERY MUCH enjoyed it. All accompanied by some Dolcetto and lovely bread.Cannot recommend this place highly enough for the quality of their meat.

Each time I visit and order a huge steak, well over a kilo each time I'm asked \"are you sure you can finish it....\" At the end of the meal they're smiling because I've finished it, I'm smiling because I'm happy and satisfied.I went there again last month. Had the Heart, nicely done, sliced cooked just right. Then I tried what they used to call Ox courage (the testicles), and the grand event, my one kilo Costata, rib steak, just some Olive oil, sea salt and the wonderful flavour of dry aged Fassona beef. Excellent. A caraf of Italian red wine did me good too.I tried a Zuppa Anglaise for dessert, it was ok.This is without doubt a super restaurant. Every time I visit London, I make sure I eat here at least once.If at all I can criticise a wee bit, I'd like to see a change in their dessert menu. The Tiramisu looked good but I don't like the flavour of coffee so I didn't have it. The other desserts maybe need a bit of change. I've seen people have the Tiramisu, they seem to enjoy it.",

Siamo entrati in questo piccolo locale e siamo stati accolti come raramente accade, con simpatia e professionalit\u00e0. Personale italiano e molto ben preparato ad illustrare pietanze e vini. Il proprietario, originario di Genova ha portato a Londra la carne Fassona Piemontese e prodotti italiani di prima qualit\u00e0. Ci ha simpaticamente intrattenuto e coccolato. Nell'attesa ci hanno \"omaggiato\", cosa rarissima, di ben due taglieri con focaccia genovese fatta in casa ed ottimi salumi.

        "Review: Went for dinner with a friend/client. It's designed for meat lovers. You choose your cut of beef, they prepare it and show it to you before they cook it and you share from the middle. Also you can share starters. The food was delicious, gorgeous steak well cooked and tender. The wine was great- all Italian. The set up is unusual within a butcher's shop and the atmosphere relaxed. They serve the menus from newspapers. It was busy and noisy so if you want a formal quiet dinner this is not the place. For a great beef meal with friends its fantastic. ",

I recommend L'Imperiale to share, it is a selection of cured and raw meat...well they will explain better what it is. It was fantastic, it was melt in the mouth and incredibly tasty. As to the mains, we have had the T-Bone, the Rump, the Rib eye (we always share) and they have always been cooked to perfection. One of the things we really like is the fact that there was lots of information on exactly where the meat,the food and the wines come from.The wines were excellent, every occasion we followed the advice of the Main Maitre after explaining our taste, and he never failed.Consider it a treat, as it is not cheap, but well worth every penny.",

Abbiamo deciso di fare un men\u00f9 uguale per tutti composto da tagliere misto iniziale + carne con contorni (se non erro costate per tutti). Appena seduto ci \u00e8 stato chiesto, in modo molto garbato e coinvolgente (forse anche troppo per il tipo di cliente che sono io) se volessimo un drink pre-dinner e abbiamo optato per uno spritz generale. Dopo uno spritz, un tagliere misto mediocre (dal mio punto di vista, sono emiliano e sui salumi ovviamente sono super critico), una buona quantit\u00e0 di carne con vino annesso (6-7 bottiglie in 11) con caff\u00e8 e qualche amaro sul tavolo il prezzo \u00e8 stato di 100\u20ac a testa. Personalmente ho trovato il conto salato...in quanto italiano appena arrivato a Londra la stessa cifra l'avrei spesa altrove! Comunque Londra \u00e8 Londra e i prezzi sono alti si sa ma forse, per una categoria di clienti come me (ragazzo giovane, abituato alla buona cucina italiana con il suo rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo) non ne vale la pena!

The restaurant and staff are certainly welcoming even if the interior and furnishings are on the eclectic side of the taste spectrum! It really annoys me when a restaurant opens for business but then says that certain menu items aren't available... even more so when it relates to its most important meat cuts!That being said the starters were delicious and the steaks were cooked perfectly with nicely done side dishes. Decent wine selection and with desserts, coffees and the grappas (has to be done!) the bill for two was a hefty \u00a3223 including service.Not sure if this is trying to be an upmarket steak restaurant or a good Italian restaurant but whatever it doesn't quite measure up to the best in either category ....

In tutti tre i locali io e la mia famiglia siamo rimasti letteralmente impressionati dalla bont\u00e0 e dalla genuinit\u00e0 dei cibi serviti da personale competente, disponibile, affabile e sempre pronto ad accertarsi che tutto fosse di nostro gradimento, mettendoci al corrente, ad ogni portata, della provenienza e della preparazione di ci\u00f2 che ci accingevamo a mangiare e bere.Il locale Macellaio RC in South Kensington \u00e8 accogliente e ben disposto. Ci siamo fermati per un pranzo veloce ed in cerca di piatti particolari ma genuini. Dopo un antipasto misto di salumi di ottima qualit\u00e0, abbiamo ordinato ravioli al tocco e trenette al pesto (rigorosamente genovese). Ottimo il sapore ed il grado di cottura. Ci siamo avventurati poi ad assaggiare piatti che non sono per noi all\u2019ordine del giorno: cuore e testicoli cucinati in maniera favolosa e ossobuco, con contorno di insalata di finocchi e arance di Sicilia, sapori nuovi che rimangono impressi. Il tutto accompagnato da una vasta scelta di vini sapientemente suggeriti dal personale ed adatti ai cibi consumati. Complimenti vivissimi al titolare Roberto Costa che abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere e di renderci conto che \u00e8 veramente una persona semplice ed unica sia nel rapporto con la clientela che col personale: secondo me \u00e8 il datore di lavoro che tutti vorrebbero! Abbiamo visto anche la trasmissione di Alessandro Borghese \u201c4 Ristoranti\u201d e siamo pienamente d\u2019accordo che \u201cIl Macellaio RC\u201d di Roberto Costa sia risultato il miglior ristorante Italiano a Londra: la sua competenza in materia e il suo gesto finale non fanno che avvalorare la mia stima nei suoi riguardi.

        "Review: We booked this to celebrate a special occasion as a couple, having heard great things. The concept is great and we were really looking forward to a lovely evening. Unfortunately it proved to be a huge let-down. We were put in the soulless basement where one could hear a pin drop and we could easily have joined in the conversation with the couple next to us, had they been talking. The drinks order was wrong, and our water was simply forgotten. The two dishes that we were most excited about were unavailable despite it being relatively early on a Thursday evening. Although the starters were, admittedly, delicious when they finally arrived after a good forty minutes. Sadly, that was the only positive of the evening. Having been advised not to order the size of steak that I wanted, when it arrived it was too small and not with the correct accompaniments that had been ordered. So while I ate my steak without any sides, my girlfriend discovered that her supposedly rare steak (at circa \u00a350) was, in fact, medium/well done. When we sent it back (reluctantly, as we hate to cause a scene) the manager was incredibly condescending and patronising, suggesting that we were just ignorant. He even brought out a small slice of rare steak pretending it was ours, in an attempt to make us look silly. Of course, in the grand scheme of things, this is not a problem and I am usually happy just to have a plate of food in front of me. But at the prices they charge, and when steak is what you're famous for, this is inexcusable. I have no doubt that Macellaio will continue to do well because Kensington clientele are highly unlikely to venture into some of the more undiscovered boroughs of London where chefs actually have to serve up something genuinely delicious (at a fifth of the price) in order to earn their reputation, but for those who want their food served with passion but without the pretence and snootiness, I would wholly advise to look elsewhere.To their credit, our food was refunded, but the evening was ruined and we will not be recommending this place to anyone.",

        "Review: Macellaio holds to its name: Butcher in English, the quality of the meat is very good and I would recommend the Battuta all'Albese which is a tartar stake in Italian style which has a very simple and basic dressing; the low impact of this on the overall taste leave the dish's success dependant solely on the quality of the meat. It is really good. Cured ham cut tick by knife was very tasty and the burrata served with it was not one of the best I ever had but still satisfactory. As far as the main course it was a bit surprising that the waitress didn't ask how we would have like the meat cooked and that resulted in a slightly overcooked costata which was very tasty. It feels like you are in a restaurant owned by the Antionori wine producer as the wine list is full of their produce coming from Tuscany and other regions of Italy, also the attention of the ma\u00eetre de salle while consulting the wine list is a bit pushy as it seems aimed more at selling the most expensive bottle rather than providing advise: it is on the verge of being annoying. The wine list is overall very interesting even if the prices seems steep. The buss boys/girls are very active but could be more attentive. In substance very good meat, buzzing informal atmosphere and priced on the high side for the overall quality you get. Of note: as the name of the restaurant means butcher they also sell meat and it is worth trying it as Italian meat has generally a stronger taste than British one.",

        "Review: Recently when visiting London for a relative's birthday party, we were taken to this amazing steakhouse. Before arriving here, I had peeked at the menu, but had no idea of what we were about to experience. Fassona beef, from Piedmontese cows, raised in the north of Italy, is amazingly delicious. Seems there is a lower fat and connective tissue content to the meat and therefore it is tender and flavorful, but with fewer calories. I had never tasted any beef like this in my life.We digested the menu and then ordered our \"cuts\". Four people decided upon the Fiorentina (T-bone), another the Filetto (fillet mingion) and two of us the Tailgate (rump steak) in two different preparations. I had been in Montana a month before and had a Culotte, (rump) steak there, and was curious to compare the two.We ordered a bottle of wine and were warned that it was the last of it's kind and that's when the service got weird. Some first courses arrived with bread and there was delicious olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but no vessels in which to pour the liquids - 15 minutes later that was solved. A wooden board, with the meat we had ordered, was presented and it was a good thing. The filetto was 250g which was way too large for the person who ordered it. They cut it smaller and everyone was happy. This was the theater part of the dinner.Everything was fairly well paced until they delivered the two Tagliate steaks a good 5 minutes before the others. We started to enjoy it anyway, but it wasn't conducive to a coherent meal. By the way, this steak was better than the one I had in Montana, (sorry US beef suppliers) The \"special\" steaks were then presented and dinner went on as usual, except a request to supply additional vegetables and chips (steak fries), took twenty minutes to complete.If it sounds like this was an unpleasant experience, it wasn't. Regardless of the uneven service, we had a really fun night and the food was fantastic. Had the service been a little more consistent they would have earned a fifth star.If you think you know beef, but haven't had Fasonna, check this out, it's fantastic!",

        "Review: It pains me deeply to write this review, because our first visit to the restaurant in Oct 2013 (then called Maxela) was amazing. We had a truly fantastic meal and the food absolutely amazing. But I have to be honest about our experience in Dec 2016, because it was so very far from that. In short, we were extremely disappointed.The meatball starter was truly horrible. It was so dry, over-cooked & tasteless, I spat mine back out into the plate. As did a few others.The main course was hit & miss. Some really enjoyed their steak, but myself & a few others got a bum deal. What looked like a nice piece of meat ended up being very sinewy & fatty. All I got was a few mouthfuls of decent steak.And then the chips. They were very nice but we only got about three or four each. Literally. So very mean given how expensive the meal ended up being.Then dessert. Nothing to write home about. Again, the batter was very over-cooked and there wasn't much of it. Totally under-whelming, I'm afraid.For what ended up being a \u00a370 meal each, it was really disappointing. Especially when compared to the amazing experience we had there a few years ago. It couldn't have been further from that. Very over-priced for what we got, and the food was, on the whole, really quite poor.I honestly can't work out the reason for this, other than the first time we went, we ate \u00e0 la carte. This time we were made to eat off a set group menu (which limited our choice), and given we knew the overall meal was going to be expensive, we decided to opt for the cheapest \u00a330 option. I would therefore conclude by saying...avoid the set menu and eat \u00e0 la carte!Lastly, there was a mess with the bill at the end. If it wasn't for one of my eagle-eyed friends, I would have missed the fact that each of us were over-charged by about \u00a35. That was sorted by the manager straight away, but it made the end of an already disappointing night rather stressful.On the whole it's such a shame, because what was our favourite Meat Club venue, has ironically now become one of the worst.",

We went for rib eye 600g for 2 people and it was a bit fatty but like I said the meat was 5/5 beautiful, we would probably order about 800g next time as it was small.

        "Title: Disappointing ",
        "Review: I booked this for New Year Eve dinner based upon reviews and proximity to where we were staying. I had high hopes and looked forward to ushering in the new year with great food and company. Restaurant is narrow with meat displayed in window and behind a counter. Two men work at front of restaurant behind the counter, cutting huge slabs of gorgeous beef and preparing amazing looking beef tartare and other plates. Seating is in two levels. We arrived at 9:25 for our 9:30 booking and were promptly seated (always a good thing!). The menu is designed to look like a newspaper. There is a nice variety of options. Our server Elisa recommended the \"rib\" (prime rib) for 2 which we also ordered the roasted potatoes, spinach and the heart for a starter.Our experience:We were seated at the first table inside the restaurant. My view was of the hostess station, the men cutting the huge blocks of beef and preparing gorgeous \"crudo\" plates. That was very interesting for me to watch them use huge butcher knives to chop enormous pieces of beef for guests. But after waiting an hour for our starters to arrive, the entertainment factor wore thin. Also, being close to the front door, it got drafty as the evening wore on.The food: We had the heart for a starter. It said it was prepared with garlic, chilli and herbs. We didn't notice any of those flavour profiles but did appreciate the sea salt and the accompanying horseradish sauce.The beef was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Highlight of the meal.Sides: we shared roasted potatoes (which appeared to be really fried but nonetheless tasty) and spinach (menu said was to be prepared with garlic and butter...was a bit oily)Service:This was the biggest downfall and disappointment. We were promptly seated but that's about the only highlight of the service we received. We placed our order and we waited more than an hour for our starter to be served. We did receive an offering of salami and prosciutto. The restaurant appeared to have many friends and acquaintances present for NYE. I think that was a bit a distraction for the other diners who (like us) were there just for a meal as we noticed the friends who arrived after us were served very quickly and others who had no connection waited at length. To me, service what can set you apart from other establishments. I'm not sure the food could outweigh the current service standard we experienced. ",

One of the best meals I've had in the last few years, and while not cheap, I felt like our roughly $150 check for two (with a bottle of wine, steak, procuitto, ossobucco, and some vegetables) was a fantastic value for the quality.

After cooked they were making parallel slices to the bone this of course was killing the tenderness because they were cutting the meat fiber.This kind of mistake are unacceptable for a 200 GBP meal and for a restaurant that has the meat as core meal!!!

        "Review: I have had the good fortune to visit Macellaio twice over the last year: last years' company Christmas party and the celebration of the wedding of close friends over the Summer. On both occasions, Macellaio has delivered a thoroughly enjoyable evening with outstanding food and service. Most of the reviews regarding this famed establishment focus on the Fassona steak (which is of course first class). However, the quality of all ingredients on their tantalizing menu are really second to none: the burrata, the hearts fried in garlic and chili, the green beans and broccoli to name but a few.Outstanding food aside, the restaurant itself is always loud and busy so service can be a little challenging, but is always enthusiastic, friendly and attentive. The knowledge of the staff is extensive and frankly its almost better just to tell them your preferences and let them take over!You get what you pay for at Macellaio and this level of quality does not come cheap. Having said that, value is a subjective thing and I challenge to find quality like this elsewhere in London for the price. Most significantly, at Macellaio your connection with what your eating is strong as you have to walk through what is essentially a butcher's store front to your table. In a time when we have become increasingly separated from the origins of our ingredients, this is a particularly poignant reminder of what real food is and should be about.",

        "Review: My partner and I went here yesterday for dinner with another couple of friends.On arrival we were warmly greeted and invited to our table. From the first seconds in the restaurant we were made to feel very comfortable and relaxed.We started with still and sparkling water for the table while we decided on the wine. We did choose a quite inexpensive red wine, which was great actually, quite light and went on very well with the food, as we ordered a second bottle after the starters.So, for starters: my partner and I chose a very meaty platter to share (bresaola, prosciutto, salame, tartares and carpaccio) together with some home bread, while our friends chose some individual starters, such as tartares, burrata etc. Our lovely server Elisa, couldn't have been better, we were surprised of how knowledgeable she is of all the products, she presented us the food incredibly, letting us know of the origin of each product, how is it made etc. Great way to start our dinner!We have also received a basket of foccacina on the house which was very tasty.The food was all superb, hence we didn't leave a single bit on our plates!!For mains: our friends ordered 800g of fiorentina t-bone and us 700g which initially I wanted it cooked medium-well. Elisa advised us it is best served medium-rare and offered to get it cooked medium-rare for us to taste it and if I would still want it cooked more, she will get it cooked more for us. That would've been a one time for me, as I always have eaten my steak medium-well, but I said - hell yes, why shouldn't I listed to my server, especially because she seemed so knowledgeable about her steak, so I decided to go her way. I couldn't have been more satisfied of the choice!!! The steak was so delicious, it was literally melting in my mouth so obviously I didn't want it cooked more at all! All the flavours were just brilliant, the meat was pure heaven ( and right now I started to dream about last night and I think I'm gonna cry..). All four of us were very satisfied with both food and amazing service given by Elisa. Also the manager was very nice and attentive with us. After we \"erased\" everything from the plate, we decided to have some deserts to share as well as some digestives to call it a night. We had the bartender coming to our table letting us know about all the digestives, grappas etc they have, which were offered on the house as well!!Booking our dinner quite late, by the time we finished it was around midnight, but not at any moment we felt pushed or hurried. All four of us working in the hospitality industry, it is definitely not easy for all of us to agree and be so satisfied both with food and service. As a restaurant manager, if all my staff would be like Elisa I would be blessed!We enjoyed our dinner so much at Macellaio RC and we will definitely be visiting again soon!All the best to Elisa and all the staff who made us feel so welcomed and to the chefs for such amazing steak in London!!",

        "Review: Sono stato al Macellaio per una serata di lavoro. Il locale appare all'esterno come una macelleria, con i tagli di carne appesi ai ganci e il banco da macellaio all'ingresso (la carne e' tagliata al momento secondo le richieste). Siamo stati al piano inferiore, arredato con tavoli ed arredi stile \"rigattiere\", ed il cui personale (Fulvio e Giordana) e' cortese e professionale al tempo stesso, disponibile a consigliarci e a soddisfare le nostre richieste. Il menu' offre, oltre a diversi tipi di tagli (fiorentina, costate di varie dimensioni, tagliate di vario tipo), anche la possibilita' di assaggi regionali (lingua e salsa verde, coda alla vaccinara, bruschette con il lardo, etc.) e un assortimento di salumi italiani (che non abbiamo assaggiato). Buona la carta dei vini, con proposte di abbinamento legate alla cottura della carne. I desserts sono buoni, anche se non eccezionali; d'altronde il punto di forza del locale e' la qualita' della carne offerta. Infine, il locale non e' economico, ma considerata sia la posizione in un quartiere elegante, sia che si mangia bene e con un ottimo servizio, credo che il prezzo sia adeguato.",

        "Review: Ordered the steak tartare. It was so bland on the top and when I got to the bottom it was over salted and loaded with capers and onions. Not sure what happened with the mixing and the seasoning but it was rather disappointing and a bit inconsistent in its flavour profile throughout the dish. My partner ordered tagliatelle and was expecting delicious pasta with melt in your mouth meat as this is, ahem, a meat place. No, what he received was bland pasta with bland meat that compared to a Waitrose instant Italian meal. Honestly, one could get better value with the Waitrose meal. The service was so slow and appalling, the waitress, although sweet, forgot to serve us tap water and when she brought out the hand cut fries didn't bother to offer to bring out ketchup or mayonnaise so we ended up dipping the fries in the bland tagliatelle sauce. Honestly for \u00a34.90, the fries were the only tasty part of the overpriced tasteless meal. The worst was we thought the service was so bad and slow because we assumed the front of the restaurant might've been busy as we were seated in the back, lo and behold when we left, there wasn't anyone out front!! The staff were just too busy to bother serving the customers and seemed bothered by the simple task of getting tap water. Not a good sign when an Italian restaurant that specialises in meat serves bland overpriced food where the winner of the meal is the overpriced hand cut fries. Real failure. The menu had so much potential. Avoid this establishment and save yourself the \u00a330 to be ignored. ",

The Beef tartare with spicy gorgonzola was incredible and highly recommend it as a starter before tucking into a fiorentina t-bone. Macellaio is my new favorite London steak house.",

        "Title: Disappointed",
        "Review: We were staying at the Kensington hotel in London and wanted somewhere to eat one evening.I had seen reviews for Macellaio,and being a carnivore decided it looked just the thing.We went at 6pm and got a table without reservation.The waiter steered us towards rib of beef which was fine with my wife and I.We were given steak knives in a rather dramatic fashion by sticking the knife point first into the table!We were told the rib would be about 700g and would come cut up ready to eat.I know there is a big bone in rib but what we got was about 100g of eatable meat.Apart from the bone the rest was fat,gristle and sinew.Even the eatable meat we had was difficult to cut-not helped by the steak knife being blunt.It was not even very tasty.This was the worst steak I have ever had-and I have had a lot.The steak came with a small portion of chips and a small plate of salad.We also had two beers,500ml of wine,two coffees and one ice cream.The bill came to \u00a393!This was the worst meal out I have ever had.Looking at all the other reviews I can only think that we were unlucky with the piece of meat we were served.This is why I have given two stars and not one.However,whoever cut the meat up must have seen it was pretty poor and nowhere near worth the cost.My onl regret is that I did not complain at the time.The amount of bone,fat and gristle on our plates was evidence enough that value for money it was not.",

        "Review: I was walking past this place (actually on my way to another steakhouse) when I stopped to peep inside. The lady asked if I wanted to try their steak and I told her where I was heading. She said \"Our steaks are better\" I sat down for dinner and now this is my favourite restaurant in London....It is a macelleria (a butcher shop) and a steakhouse. I tried a big beef rib steak, well over a kilo. It was delicious, simply done with just olive oil and rock salt, no sauce to kill the taste of the aged Fassone beef.They usually serve the steak on a skillet sliced up. On a later visit I asked them to serve it uncut. You can ask the macellaio to show you the cuts and select your steak.If you're not a beefeater this is not the place for you.They have a couple of dishes that I'd like to try on later visits, Ox courage (fried bull's testicles) and Cuore (heart with garlic, chilli and herbs)The macellaio and the staff are very pleasant. There's this waitress, a young lady from Genoa who is very chirpy and pleasant.I've only tried one of their desserts, the Marmalade crostata. I'll try a couple of others later.The restaurant is not very big. They have the macelleria and the dry aging cabinet at the entrance, wooden tables and chairs and a quaint decor. They use bent spoons nailed to the wall as coat hooks. Once you order your steak they jab a steak knife into the table.They have a decent selection of wines to go with the steak.I can't wait to visit London again, just for this steak.",

        "Review: The front window of this Italian butcher/restaurant looks into the small cold store where several pieces of Italian beef are hung to dry age, and once inside you see the butchery/retail counter with several cuts of blackened aged beef. Further inside is the small dining room.For my lunch I didn't want to go for anything too heavy, so I had steak tartare followed by calf liver. All around me I could see diners being shown amazing pre-cooked steaks they had ordered, then brought out nicely sliced after cooking. They looked fantastic, huge, and ideal for sharing.My tartare was very tender and delicious, properly mixed with shallot, capers, gerkins, and worcester sauce, mustard and a hint of tabasco. It didn't have a raw egg on top, in the French style, and it didn't come with any bread or sourdough, which I missed. I would recommend ordering a side of grilled bread with lardo to go with it.My liver was delicious, though a smallish portion which resembled a starter. I ordered a side of mashed potato with nutmeg to go with it, but unfortunately the mash was very lumpy and unpleasant to eat.I still had room for a dessert and I chose the Latte Dolce Fritto, which turned out to be a custard deep fried in small squares of donut-like batter with a dusting of sugar. They were lovely, and came with some similar deep fried rectangles containing nutella.The wine list is novel, by matching wines to how well done the meat you have ordered is, so I looked to the friendly waiter for advice on what to have with my liver. I had a very pleasant carafe of Syre for \u00a319.After lunch I bought some fillet steak to take home, which gave me a lovely carpaccio the next day, and some lardo, which adds amazing flavour to other products including the warm bread rolls I had with the carpaccio.I will definitely return for one of their impressive looking steaks.",

        "Review: This cozy steakhouse has everything to represent well the Genoese tradition.In Italy there is a saying implying that you can eat every single piece of the pork (praising the wide range of products made from a single animal). You can easily replace pork with Fassona, which is the focus of Macellaio RC's menu.My meal started with some salami, awesome homemade bread (perfect in salt and impressively not burnt, unlike 90% of the focaccia bread in the UK) and followed by some good ravioli topped with a little escalope and its tomato juice. I recommend asking for Parmesan after enjoying the meat, they generally keep salt at minimum and ravioli should have some grated cheese on top.About the steak, the Neapolitan butcher helped me to choose based on my reluctance towards rare and thick steaks: the rib cut was definitely a good spot and tremendously tender, thanks for the long ageing process (they explained to me it's alternative to marinades typical of Argentinian steaks).The tiramisu was good too but it might be better with more biscuits soaked in coffee (barely a couple at the very bottom of the pot); honest revision to the classic recipe, the cream was not too thick but it needs something to balance its sweetness.If you add that, from the room manager to waitress to butcher, the whole staff was kind and happy to help, the experience at Macellaio RC is definitely worth my praise.Pricing can be misleading: even though above average for non-meat products, the quality is definitely higher than their prices. I guess the main downside is that, with such a large menu, you will end up ordering more than a single steak, hence the perception of being too pricey on the whole (which is not true, compared to other steakhouses).If you want to experiment regional Italian cuisine, Macellaio RC is certainly an easy choice in West London. Even though still not perfect, service is definitely very good and asking for help before ordering is a must: the range of meat is so wide you can easily go straight to the cheap tagliata cut and missing the best of their food.Looking forward to trying offal course next time! Also, don't miss the third restaurant opening soon, it will feature a more practical menu with a new co-protagonist: the Genoese focaccia, one of the most renowned in the world!",

        "Review: Forget Gaucho, Goodman and Hawksmoor. This place is awesome.Antipasto was fantastic. This was followed by grilled heart and 2 versions of steak tartare. One with smoked salt and olive oil, the other with blue gorgonzola. Delicious. There were 3 of us so we ordered a 2kg T-bone which was cooked to perfection and simply fantastic. The staff are great and extremely knowledgeable. An extensive wine list with some of the best from Tuscany, Piedmont and Veneto. A must return. Grazie mille guys!",

The meats are simply flavoured and I'd recommend the T-Bone with sea salt and rosemary. It's not cheap but it's the best. The chips are the healthiest I've seen - no fat.

        "Review: Entering with the sight of a butcher counter and some serious meats on display sets the scene for a steak night to remember..Great concept of Italian steak house, with very friendly and knowledgeable staff, mostly Italian. No piece of the \"manza\" (the beef of their choice for the meat) goes to waste, with heart, liver and tongue on the menu, together with the more traditional \"tagliata\" (thin sliced fillet, medium-rare) and the specialty dish \"Fiorentina\" (thick, on the bone, huge steak, cut on the spot by the butcher) among other succulent options.The setting is rustic, great wine selection and pairing recommendations and the cooking does justice to the meat (in my opinion, when meat is involved, the less the chef does, the better the result, and here this is what you get).The prices match the place: good meat does not come cheap. If you go hard on the meat (that is, a 1-1.2kg fiorentina), expect a bill around 50-60\u00a3 pp, while if you settle for a filling and hearty tagliata and starters, 30-40\u00a3 will do..",

        "Review: Our dinner at Macellaio started with some mixed appetizers. We tasted some Salame and Bresaola, Lardo with Honey and nuts, afterwards we had three different starters based on raw meat: the Battuta all'Albese, the Battuta with spicy gorgonzola and Modena Balsamico and the Steak Tartare. We ordered also Stracciatella cheese as accompaniment to the meat appetizers. AMAZING. But this is just the beginning. We took a 800g beef rib with roasted potatoes and purple sprouts as sides. The tenderness of the meat is incomparable to every steak I tasted here in London. Delicious.We have to say that the service at Macellaio is as amazing as the food. We've been served by Lello (the Butcher), Maurizio and Walter. The incredible dedication of these people to their products and to the customer will leave you speechless. You will become a part of the story of every person behind the delivering of your steak, furthermore you will have the opportunity to eat in high class restaurant who makes you feel as welcome as at your own home.So thank you to all Macellaio RC team who has given us a wonderful evening.We will come back for sure.",

I had the ham and Gorgonzola to start which was great - no cooking involved but presented nicely and the bread which I was trying to avoid (need to go on a diet!) was too good to put down. My boyfriend had the steak tartare with Gorgonzola which he said was one of the best he's had in london. Personally the thought of eating tartare is off putting to me but seeing him rave about it so much I tried a tiny bit which I could see why if you like that style of food you'd love it but still not enough to convince me to have a whole one!My only niggle is I'd have liked more variety in the starters but that's just a personal preference. We shared the florentine steak which was faultless. Most of the propel dining were having this dish so I think it must be their signature. 1 bottle of water, 1 bottle of wine, 2 starters, 2 mains \u00a3170 Food: 4/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Price: 3.5/5",

We asked for help in working out how much to order for 3- at \u00a358-70 per kilo you don't want to get it wrong - but no way was our waiter going to offer any advice and nor was any help given in the menu. As most of the cuts have a bone in them it's not so easy to gauge . After getting nowhere with the waiter we just ordered the individual steaks. These are very thin ,cut up in the kitchen and put on a piece of slate - which is chilly stuff. By the time they get to the table the steak is cold - not I think how most people want it ? It also means that the sauces e.g the gorganzola one I ordered don't melt onto the steak - it's just a lump of cheese sitting on cold meat.Overall not really enjoyable.",

You can choose your meat from the butchers out front or from the menu and they bring you the cut to the table. They recommended 1.KG for four and it was just about right (four big blokes would disagree).The starters were very tasty and a bit different too. We chose the Bardolino from the vast wine list but they didn't have it so we had a decent Valpolicella instead. The service was friendly and pretty good.

Comfort (or discomfort) first: we were sitting in a table inside, in a corner and halfway through he meal it all became unbearably hot: yes, it was one of London's hot days, but still unacceptable for this type of restaurant to not invest on a decent air conditioning system; also, it was full and it got so loud it was nearly impossible to hear my guest speak. Service also patchy and distracted: we were asked for our orders within 3 minutes of arriving, and we legitimately asked for a little more time; 20 minutes later no one had come back to our table so we had to get the waiter's attention; that distraction carried on throughout the meal, including asking twice and still having a 15 minutes wait for the bill, in a hot room: in the end, we had to get up and pay on our way out to get any attention. Not sure if I'll be back...experience more than food is what I remember after this visit. ",

The meat and offal is sitting in the counter top the left as you walk through the door and I had the best fillet steak I have ever had at any restaurant in London. Don't visit this place if you don't like meat, but if you do, then get there as soon as possible. the startaers are delicious too - try the meats and cheeses as a sharing plate - fabulous. And it's a great wine list - not inexpensive but a great choice. Another great eaterie hidden away in London that all meat lovers should head for asap.",

        "Title: All about steaks",
        "Review: My friends and I ate in Macellaio last week after we read good reviews about its sister restaurant in Exmouth Market. It's very attractively designed, has a pleasantly busy atmosphere and its appearance - almost a butchers-meets-restaurant - is a set-up which works well and adds drama. The highlight here is the meat and it really is as good as almost all the reviews make clear. It's certainly towards the top of the tree when it comes to steak in London. There is also an extensive Italian wine list with some excellent options.On the flipside, and perhaps as a consequence of being considered alongside the beef, the sides seemed a little meagre, slightly mundane and overpriced. Similarly although the welcome was warm there were occasions when the service edged away from being friendly/helpful into faintly pushy 'upselling' territory.All things considered, and if you're a lover of steaks, it's worth a visit.",

It was lavish quantities of beef which lead to us opting for the steak tartare to start, followed by a T-bone and rib steak to share. The meat was exceptional - so good in fact that I ate it without any mustard - a move that I never thought I'd go for! The chips were golden, crisp and delicious. The vegetable sides were too small, but still well executed. The red wine was also great as were the desserts and cheeses. I much preferred this to the other steak restaurants and chains in London.

        "Title: It was ok...",
        "Review: \u200bWe visited as a group of 7 on a Saturday night. After some beef carpaccio and steak tartare as starters we shared 1.5kg cuts of T-bone ('Fiorentina') and rib of beef as mains. The central part of each cut was very tender and of a good quality, however the pieces near the end were quite fatty/chewy. I would estimate around a quarter to a third of the meat was in the latter category, which is not an insignificant amount! We ordered a few sides and these were generally decent, with the mashed potatoes being a favourite. We also tried out a few desserts which again were decent.Service was friendly, although it could be quite slow at times. All the staff seemed to be from Italy, which gave it an authentic feel. Our bill came to \u00a356 each, of which around \u00a315 was spent on drinks.A comment on timings - at the time of booking as well as upon arrival we were told about a 2 hour limit on our table. They were strict about this and ended up rushing us to vacate our table at the end of the meal. Which would have been fine except: 1) although we arrived on time they were 10 min late to seat us (so we had our table for 1 hour 50 min effectively); and 2) as mentioned the service was slow at times. Given the time limit I would have expected a bit more urgency on their side. On a related note, I would suggest that they extend the time limit for larger group sizes (which is commonly done in other restaurants), as larger groups naturally tend to take a bit longer.To conclude - it was not a bad meal and prices were quite reasonable, but you could definitely get better steak in London. For similar concepts (i.e. big cuts of meat for sharing) at a comparable price point, I'd suggest trying out Zelman or Blacklock.",

        "Review: We were in South Kensington looking for a good steak restaurant. We found il Macellaio.This restaurant is specialized in Fassona meat, grown in Piedmont area, North West of Italy.The atmosphere is kind and relaxed.Waiters were very friendly, a little directive in the wine choice, but very collaborative when they realized we had a clear opinion about what we wanted to drink.We had a Carpaccio of Fassona with rucola and parmesan cheese, spectacular!We also chose the Fiorentina (800 grams to share in two people). Excellent as well. We closed with a Bianco dessert with basel flavor, very refreshing.The service had a few particularities when they count down before uncovering the main course or when they stab the table with the knive.So we spent a pleasant evening and enjoyed the dinner. Perfect!The price? Remember you are in South Kensington London....",

They did not visit my table to enquire after my order or offer me a drink. I was given no advice regarding the extensive menu and when I tried to order, was even told by one waitress to deal with someone else. Theynever engaged in any conversation. Thankfully I managed to get the attention of the barstaff and he took my order.Thankfully the quality of the food and the wine (recommended by the bar staff) made up for the unwelcoming and uncomfortable service. The beef tartare was tasty and the portion plentiful. The main of rump steak was also very nice, if a little overlooked for blue. This however is my personal taste and no reflection on the quality of meat. I can only imagine the waiter and waitress were disappointed with having a single diner and the 12.5% top of a \u00a350 bill. I selected this restaurant because of the menu and as a lover of red meat, I was really looking forward to dining here. Unfortunately the staff spoilt my experience and I could not wait to leave. ",

        "Review: After I have seen pictures of the foods, I decided to come and taste this italian restaurant with my partner. Simply faboulous. From the beginning, we started to talk with the chef, he advised to taste specialties. For starter, we ate two kind of steak tartara, \"d'albese\" without any sauce (just salt, oil and pepper) and with sauce. Fassone Meat from Italy, exactly from Piemonte. Very very good and taste. Also we ate italian cheese included in the starter, called \"Burrata\" from Puglia. After that, we ate \"Costata\" , Fassone steak , simply divine. For drink, we advise Ripasso Valpolicella, fantastic with this kind of meat. Thanks to the sommeliere, very helpful. For finish, we tried homemade cakes, cheescake and tiramis\u00f9, always special. Thanks to Lello, the chef, we tried \"lardo d'Arnad\" with wallnuts and honey and \"Bresaola\" homemade. What else? Divine!",

The beef is sublime, the dry aged cure gives a tenderness that few butchers can compete with and frankly supermarkets cannot even imagine. All of this with an Italian style and extensive list of Italian wines makes it a must experience restaurant. It is not cheap, but frankly worth every penny. The starters with the selection of Carpaccio and steak tartar, followed by two huge cuts of beef between the 4 of us was fantastic. Only complaint that the side dishes were a little miserly in the portion size, but that didn't spoil the overall experience. Really worth a visit, I will be back next time that I am in London",

It was cooked to perfection and served cut off the bone and sliced though we also had the meaty bones to scrape. Which we did. The roast potatoes are an excellent accompaniment - far better than chips as they are small and cooked with rosemary. A good recommendation by the waiter. The mixed vegetables were also great. Good service for us - the staff to table ratio means that they are kept busy but we did not have to wait more than was appropriate for the cooking.

Abbiamo optato, quindi, per una tagliata con contorno, ed un calice di vino consigliatoci dal personale. Non discuto la qualit\u00e0 delle pietanze che ci sono state servite, ma le porzioni presentate. La tagliata era davvero misera, come il suo condimento messo in un angolino del tagliere sul quale ci \u00e8 stata servita. Idem dicasi per il calice, che era pieno a met\u00e0, di conseguenza il prezzo pagato per ci\u00f2 che abbiamo consumato davvero alto.

Everyone was welcoming and friendly and we were treated to an interesting explanation of the Italian origins of this traditionally produced meat.

Quite simply the best I've ever had. We had it rare, as we like it, but cooked so that it was nice and crispy on the outside. Perfect. It came with delicious roasted Rosemary potatoes.

I have walked past a few times and to be honest I hadn't even realised it was a restaurant, from the outside a quick glance you could easily think it was just a butcher. I am thankful we tried. The staff were great, but more importantly the food was amazing. We decided to stick to meat and I am glad we did, it was seasoned and cooked fantastically.",

The Fassone breed of cattle is found in Piedmont and the animals are butchered at much older ages than is generally the case \u2013 this, plus the feed regime (no feedlots here) and the ageing \u2013 gives an incredibly flavoursome meat which is set off perfectly by the very simple presentation \u2013 seared in salt and oil.Easily one of the top beef destinations on the planet.",

I hate it when male waiters just talk to my male companion. Hello, there is another diner here. I also hate it when one has to ask for the bill twice and yet still have to get up and go to the till to pay as there is no service. Anyway, getting back to the main point. The food. The carpaccio was good, as was the tartare. The caponata was amazing. The Fiorentina (T-bone) was just a bitter disappointment. My knife couldn't cut through a lot of it as it was so sinewy. The flavour of the meat was ok, but I have had so much better, which is why if this purports to be all about the best cuts and types of beef that I was so disappointed. My advice is if you are a meat lover, save yourself the disappointment and just head on down to Hawksmoor.",

        "Review: OK, it's London, it's meat (and of excellent quality) and it's posh South Kensington, so if you are looking for a cheap Italian 'Fiorentina' or 'Tagliata', skip page.Hence the bottom line with Il Macellaio is whether this is worth the price, in the range of 40 to 50 pounds (if you pay attention to your choice of wine...see later). Also, let me stress that I am a BBQ cook, and often grill Fiorentina chosen from my personal butcher at home in Italy, so I am naturally biased when it comes to grilled cow.Having said this, I'd rate this Fiorentina on an absolute scale a 8/10, so good to very good. Not excellent, because the filet part was a shy tougher than it should have been for perfection (i.e. the consistency of butter). And to be honest, this could have been due to the fact that we had Fiorentina only for two, so a small cut, hence maybe a part that was not perfectly aged. The cooking was however perfect, and also the 'Tagliata' that two other colleagues got (they serve this in different ways) tasted very good. Entrees are also top quality.The only downside I have with this restaurant is the wine list. It is extensive, and with some very good bottles, but the pricing is totally distorted from the bottom. While it is ok to pay 30 to 40 pounds a bottle worth 20 euros in Italy (ie roughly twice the price), it is not acceptable to pay 25 pounds for a bottle worth 5 or 6 euros (ie almost six times the price). So watch out.",

After a short wait we were seated and our lovely host Lorenzo arranged drinks and explained the menu.We were seated at the front of the restaurant opposite the butchery counter. Whilst perusing the menu 'Lello' the butcher approached our table and made some recommendations.On his advice we ordered 2 starters to share then a kilo of rib eye and a kilo of T-Bone to share with a few sides.The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty......fabulous!Lorenzo learned that it was my partners birthday tomorrow and arranged a portion of the most delicious chocolate cake presented with a candle whilst staff and other customers sang a chorus of 'Happy Birthday'.A wonderful evening made very special by Lello & Lorenzo's attentiveness, the 'theatre' of being seated near the butchery counter and the best meat I have had for some time.Many Thanks",

Arrivati il tavolo non era pronto e ci hanno indicato un posto vicino in cui bere qualcosa nell'attesa perch\u00e9 l\u00ec non c'era spazio.Pessimo.Una volta rientrati e aver aspettato ancora in fila al freddo e dove do richiamare l'attenzione del pedonale perch\u00e9 nessuno era al ricevimento abbiamo ordinato e dopo una lunga attesa finalmente abbiamo potuto mangiare.Il cameriere (Walter) ricordo bene il nome, ha portato gli antipasti con aria frettolosa \u00e8 molto maleducata.Mi ha passato un piatto che non era mio e io in tutta tranquillit\u00e0 gli ho detto che non avevo preso quello. Lui con aria seccata e con una confidenza che neanche mia sorella mi da, mi ha detto \"BEH PASSALO NO?!?\".Non ci sono parole.Tutti zitti abbiamo aspettato che si allontanasse e sconvolti abbiamo pensato a quanto fosse maleducato .In ogni caso la carne era buona.Ma non ci torner\u00f2",

        "Review: My wife and I stumbled across this place on our last night in London, after we had eaten elsewhere. The display of meat in the window and inside was so spectacular, that we decided we would have to try it. The only option was for lunch the next day before we traveled home. One of the best decisions we ever made!!! Although a bit heavy for lunchtime I ordered a 700 gram T bone and my wife had a smaller rib eye. The steaks were cut from the meat on display, shown to us and taken to be cooked to our liking. The waiter Lorenzo explained to us the way the beef was reared, selected, and dry aged, matured. The maitre de discussed our wine preferences and selected 3 bottles that he thought would suit our taste.The one we selected was perfectly matched to our described taste. The steaks were served, cooked exactly as ordered, on the bone, and sliced after being cooked. The taste, texture, and flavour of the meat was absolutely outstanding. In fact we agreed that this is probably the tastiest steak we have ever had. Although high end price wise it was worth every penny, and next time we are in London, Marcellaio will be revisited. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting London, for world class quality steaks, and service ",

They have an impressive wine list and dine when you are reasonably hungry, since the steaks are considerably huge.The carpaccio I ordered lacked any taste (it is cubed than thinly sliced) and I asked them to turn it into the real deal which was a tartar and they were obliging. Like most of the overzealous Italian waiter, they could recommend and confuse you, but you should study the menu and order taking time. I should say a good meal, though not the best steak, but fairly priced and I would go there again.",

It has got a good concept however it is not delivered as it should be. The staff is trained to be relaxed and friendly but they all do exactly the same so at the end it's all robotic without a true personality. And you only see them when taking order and then when giving bill. Nobody checks on you during the meal, nobody is trying to keep up with the first impression you get when you first enter. Steak tartar was great,bruscheta with lardo and honey, nuts was also lovely and surprising combination but the T-bone was a bit dry and chewy.Nutmeg mash potato didn't taste of nutmeg at all but tasted more like there was a bit too much cheese, caponata wasn't very good . I would probably go back maybe just to have a glass of wine as they have good choice of wine by the glass and plate of salami and cheese at the bar but I wouldn't go back for dinner as the service is not what it should be.",

The Burrata was the best we have ever had, the Panzanella salad was lovely (although came a little late) the steak was amazing, since we went for my husband who is a meatatarian I usually have a fish or chicken but I had the rump steak and it was delicious, we didn't need the chocolate cake but it was really exceptional and warm from the oven.

        "Review: I was invited to this restaurant very recently and I was told that it was Italian food. What I wasn't told was that they served nothing but meat. It was a very delightful surprise to eat here as it felt like having a butcher's right next door. The meat was superb, cooked to the perfect medium-rare and garnished with a perfect side dish.I liked the choice of the staff. Very efficient. They speak English, French and Italian. They wish everyone goodbye by shaking their hand which I find to be very polite and a nice end to the perfect meal.The restaurant has the theme of a butcher's shop as the meats are on display as you enter, they cut the meat in shop in front of customers, the tables are chopping boards where the waiter sticks the steak knife before your main course.A truly impressive restaurant.Never go there without a reservation otherwise you will be deeply disappointed.",

        "Review: We recently had dinner at this restaurant. First impressions: The meat display at the entrance meant to us that this place takes meat and food in general seriously. The staff was charming, attentive and professional. By the time we were seated and looked at the menu we already knew that this place is something very special.We started off with a nice Italian sparkling wine from Franciacorta. This restaurant has a rustic setting which is very refreshing for a change from all the super sleek designed restaurants. The four of us ordered the misto imperiale for a starter to share, as well as the prosciutto crudo. The tartar was also amazing. Our main course was the fiorentina and yes, we were in heaven. We probably ordered too much food but we had invited a professional tennis player and his wife that evening so the apetite was well deserved. We then ordered the costata which was superb and then a sample of their dessert, torta cioccolato, latte dolce, tiramisu and cheesecake. A bliss! This was one of the best dinners we ever had. Congratulations to the whole team. You have created a piece of real and excellent Italian food culture in London. It was very much needed. Thank you for sharing this superb food culture with the rest of the world.",

        "Review: We might say there are two types of restaurants: there are places where, looking at the menu, you can't decide what to eat because nothing is really enticing; and there are places like Macellaio where you can't decide either...because you would like to try everything! Macellaio definitely belongs to this second category.We had home made pasta (perfectly made and perfectly cooked); I had to try the offal (heart); we had the battuto di Fassona (row meat, simply served with salt and olive oil): simply amazing. Then our competent waitress recommended a \"costata\", usually with higher fat content then the \"fiorentina\" but being Fassona was a delicious cut: this was probably the best meat I had in a very long time (and I live in Denmark!). A decadent Latte fritto as a dessert. We have a critic just for the side dishes: fries were mediocre and caponata, a mix of vegetables pan fried and seasoned with vinegar and herbs, acceptable but not on par with the rest of the dinner. Very good wine list with reasonable prices.The service is conveniently added to your bill so you don't have to tip.",

        "Review: When my colleagues said lets grab a steak later we did not realise where we were going having just googled a local steak house. When we arrived after pre booking a table we realised that we were going to struggle with our \u00a320 evening meal budget.After looking at the menu we realised we could forget our budgets and we better just go with the flow. We were served by the assistant manager who gave us a great explanation on how the restaurant works.It's effectively a butchers shop that cooks their own meat. Not only do they cook it, but they source it from a Italy and age it in their own cellars for 50 days, which they assured us makes all the difference.We decided to move straight onto the main course. The steak is served to share, and comes pre sliced.. This caused a bit of concern as everyone liked different ways of it being cooked ranging from rare to well done. We were persuaded to try it medium rare, and that if the party was unhappy they could easily grill it some more. I was very concerned as I hate the metallic taste of blood in a steak that is too rare.....I know for some this is what they like, but I hate the taste of coins in my mouth.......The assistant manager assured me that as the steak is so ages there is no blood, and although rare it would taste like no other rare steak I have tasted. He was right.The steak came out (1.3kg) and was presented to us prior to cooking. When it came cooked it looked very rare in places, but I decided to give it a go.....and I am glad I did. It was really good. Very soft and melted like butter with a great flavour. We ordered two side dishes, a mixed leaf salad and spinach to share.The food again was wonderful, but a little costly. I only drank tap water and the steak and salad come in at \u00a334 when the service charge was included. I would have liked to have seen some side dish included with the steak for that kind of money as if you decided to have a drink, the costs become a bit prohibitive for the business traveller who is eating out 5 nights a week.Saying this, the restaurant is in Kensington, where money is not a consideration for the locals, so with the amount of care, love and passion the owners put in, they probably have priced it right for their normal market.The one other consideration was the volume in the restaurant. We were seated downstairs and we struggled to hold a conversation which was a real shame. I think this is just the numbers of people and the low ceiling acoustics.I did thoroughly enjoy my meal, and I hope to visit again for a treat one day.",

I had the best carpaccio I have ever had in my life, so tasty and delicate at the same time. Went crazy for stracciatella cheese and bresaola. Even better than in Italy. Not to talk about the fiorentina steak, that was out of this world. They also do homemade focaccia which was very yum. They recommend us a wine from Calabria region (sorry I can't remember the name) that was just perfect. The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly, it seems like they are really passionated about what they're doing. They really know their stuff.Would recommend this restaurant to anybody that love meat.

I am a fan of Gaucho, Hawksmoor/Foxlow which have a different style and are both very good. I love more Macellaio because the meat tastes fresh and healthy and the guys do a fab job in arising the natural flavours of the meat without the need for sauces and other stuff. The tartare is amazing and so the main meat courses. The reason may be that these guys import the meat from Piedmont region every day. For those who do not know it, Macellaio means Butcher and beyond the attracting meats hanging on the ceiling that you can admire from the outside in the windowshop under a red kind of sexy light, you can find inside at the counter Lello from Naples who preapares and cuts meat preparing the most flavoursome taglieri. The place is also suitable for parties since they have a room downstairs. Cannot say anything about prices as both times I did not see the bill! ",

Then, the waiter comes round and Stabs the pointed end of the steak knife into the table with a very vocal twanging sound which only serves to highten expectation of a big juicy steak and your not disappointed as they hang their meat for up to fifty days and it is so tender that my Granny could eat it without her false teeth.

Started with delicious cold cuts, tartare and a burrata cheese. Exceptional. Then we shared tagliata, T-bone steak and fillet coming from Frisona beef, carefully selected and aged at the restaurant. Unforgettable. Great attention was given even to the sides and as dessert I still remember the milky taste of the best cheese cake I ever had, though I'm not really fond of sweets, usually. Surprised by the great care on each and every detail, even the wines are suggested based on the various cooking times of the steaks!!!

I had a Costata, which was mouthwateringly fantastic: the beef was both tender and very tasty. Also, you decide what size you want and the piece of raw meat is shown to you for your approval. In the menu you can even find Fiorentina steak, the Italian version of t-bone, combining the fillet and the sirloin. Remaining on food, even the starters are worth to be mentioned: besides the fantastic charcuterie (among which a special mention goes to the lard d'Arnad), the cheese available will not let you down, as for the Stracciatella -a sort of creamy mozzarella. Last, I have to pay my compliment to the waiters, which not only were discreet and precise, but they were even helping in suggesting food and drinks.

If you like beef, in all its forms (and almost all parts of the cow) then this is the place for you. We shared the L'Imperiale sharing plate and a portion of the Cuore (heart). The sharing plate was incredible, with some of the most beautiful steak tartare and beef carpaccio that I have had in London. The lardo with walnuts was divine, if my heart and thighs would let me I would eat that every day!! The cuore was beautilly cooked at the table and had an impeccable flavour. We didn't have a dessert but did share a good bottle of wine and had a grappa to finish. Both were great. The service was relaxed but attentive and all staff we came into contact with were happy and helpful. We'll definitely be returning, next time to try the steak. Thanks, Macellaio!",

        "Title: Great, but I would suggest passing on dessert",
        "Review: This is a probably a pretty unhelpful review as Macellaio is very much a MEAT restaurant, and I don't eat meat. However, I attended on Friday night with two carnivores (lapsed Hindus - i don't understand either), one of whom is a best friend. The red wine was amazing (I recall one of two bottles was from the Barolo region). The Buratta cheese (the chefs kindly prepared without sausage or polenta) was a creamy delicious delight. The pesto gnocchi was very yummy and hand made. The men seemed very, very happy with their steak. They both had 180gms each. It seemed like quite a small portion when served, although actually filled them up.The desserts were unremarkable, if not disappointing, and so I would recommend you pass on this here, and try other establishments to finish off your meal. One friend had a taste of his tiramisu and left it. The 'dolci latte' pudding were overly fried bites which just weren't pleasant.Our waiter was particularly engaging, and service was excellent, so a big tick here.For obvious reasons I wouldn't return, but if meat is what you want, this does seem like one of the best places to come in London.Given that raw hanging aging meat is stored and 'decorated' throughout, I certainly wouldn't bring especially sensitive or squeamish vegetarians.Also, I would definitely reserve a table in advance, as there is a good chance you would otherwise be turned away.",

        "Review: After reading some favourable reviews about this restaurant we decided to lunch here prior to a site seeing afternoon in London.We were very impressed with the \"in restaurant\" butchery counter with all the meats on display to enable you to pick your cut of meat. We however, opted for the rump steak. My husband opted for the steak with Gorgonzola and walnuts and I chose mine with pears in balsamic. As sides we ordered one portion of chips and one of roasted vegetables. Although the portions were small it was adequate for lunch. The taste did not disappoint and despite some sinewy sections was enjoyable.We would recommend ordering larger portions of meat if you have a big appetite as you can order any amount and the price is quoted by the kilogram.The restaurant itself looks unimposing from the exterior and perhaps a little off putting but once inside the welcome and service by the staff over comes that.There is a good selection of wines and the staff will recommend at a reasonable price which ever compliments your meal.Nice experience but not sure if I would go again.",

        "Review: I live in arguably the greatest steak area in the world - Texas. That said, I'm not easily impressed with most steak / meat restaruants. Advance apologies to London steak lovers, but it's not a city I would typically visit for a steak. However, Macellaio Roberto Costa breaks the mold and I enthusiastically recommend it for a terrific slab of beef / meat experience. It's also a great place for a fun group. Loud, lively and good energy - in South Ken where there's always a buzz with lots to do - good pubs, wine bar, clubs, etc. Beef is outstanding Prime quality (Genoa equivalent) and dry aged. The only knock/s on the place is the wine list which is a bit drab (and over priced) relative to the outstanding meat quality and also the fact that you are asked how you want your meat cooked but only really allowed medium rare - which I like any way, but don't ask someone what they want if you only cook it one way. Two bottles of wine, several course meal for 3 people and 350 quid with tip. Not the cheapest place on the planet but I still highly recommend. Lovely people, fabulous meat and a great environment. I look forward to going back!",

        "Review: My wife booked us a table for Valentine's night and, as a meat lover, this was truly heaven. The front of the restaurant is like a butchers shop, with all the hung meats on display. There's a little bar and some high tables in the front room and nice relaxed seating area through the back. It feels very authentic, you are surrounded by the Italian language, smells and, of course, beautiful foccacia drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. They strike the right balance between formal and relaxed. The staff are fantastic, very warm greetings, always smiling, attentive and very happy to tell you everything they can about the food & wine. Special praise to the sommelier - on requesting a recommendation, he described several wines and their vineyards in such intricate detail you could almost taste the wind of the Ligurian coast. We decided upon one of his recommendations, only for him to return to tell us he was very embarrassed but they'd actually sold out, so he upgraded us to a lovely Cerico Rosso, for the price of the original. A great find and happy with the price. Food wise, everything was delicious. My only slight complaint would be after the success of the wine recommendations, we told the waiter we knew we wanted a t-bone for main, but asked for them to choose us some light starters. Bearing in mind we had already ordered a large t-bone for the main, we assumed they'd bring us a salad with some cheese and cold cuts for starter. Instead a steak tartare and carpaccio arrived, with just a small handful of rocket on the board. Both the tartare and carpaccio were delicious, but I looked enviously at the hams and cheeses on other tables - this was almost at the point of red meat overload. We did eventually order some extra leaves and cheese (beautiful gorgonzola!) but I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to sample some of the gorgeous hams we'd seen on our way in. I will return to try those next time! So onto the main, a 900g t-bone, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and quite possibly the most tender steak we've ever had - it really was magical, delivered to the table with a little fanfare. The sides are good, not quite up to the standard of the rest of the meal, but nice enough. The way they dress the steaks is, I'm assuming, authentic - just a little olive oil, rosemary and seasoning, which really helps to promote the steak's natural flavour. But after 400g or so, I was wishing for a little sauce just to help finish things off. I don't think they offer any sauces at Macellaio's (maybe this is very un-Italian?), but really no complaints here. We didn't quite finish the steak, but it was a valiant effort. We tried to save some space for the cheesecake, which we'd heard was divine, and it was, but by this stage we were fit to burst. We could only share a single dessert, but I'll be back to try the tiramisu next time we go. We'll return to Macellaio's for certain, next time I'll remember to wear some looser trousers! I probably wouldn't recommend for vegetarians or non beef eaters, but if you love a steak this is the Italian Goodman's. And if I could give more than 5* for service I would. Every member of staff shook my hand and wished us a great night as we left...I felt like the Godfather!",

        "Review: Felt like a trendy Roman restaurant, place was incredibly buzzy and I'd say well over half the clientele were Italian. Steaks from the butchers section out front were phenomenal - the Fiorentine TBone quite exceptional and a little bit better than the rib we also had. Starter plate was underwhelming but mains easily made up for it. Chips have massively improved and the mustard and rosemary oil were sensational. Service was a little scatty as we got towards the end (annoying when you're trying to pay the bill) but friendly throughout. Top night.",

        "Review: We booked Macellaio based on trip adviser reviews and weren't disappointed! We arrived a little early but were sat no problem in the back which had a great ambience. We were given the menu and time to read the great background of the meat. A very helpful waiter came over and explained some different parts of the menu and also wine matched for us with a lovely red wine. The bread was amazing which we were given to snack on so well worth going hungry as all sooo nice!I had the rump with pears which was lovely with only a small chewy piece. Boyfriend had 500g rib which was on the bone and shown to us raw before cooking. Both steaks were cooked to order and asking and both were delicious! We got some roast potatoes and roast veg to share which was more than enough though just the meat would have been great! We had coffee to finish with which was lovely too.Wouldn't suggest it for a veggie meal obviously but for any meat eaters it's heaven!The whole experience was great and the food, waiters and everything was lovely. Would recommend and come back as other people's food looked lovely.",

        "Review: If you like beef, this will be one of the best steak dinners of your life. I regularly eat at top restaurants all over the US and abroad for business and pleasure, but have to say dinner at Macellaio was unforgettable. My family was in London for Christmas and we hit all the top restaurants, including Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, the Ritz etc. and this was by far the best. Food was amazing, ambiance was unique and staff was tops. While we waited for our table we received samples of the best prochutto we'd had in our lives (no kidding). Subsequently, we let the staff basically order the entire dinner for us and it couldn't have been better. I heard about Macellaio's at a business dinner in Chicago at Del Frisco's months earlier and the person raved about it. Told my wife and she tried to change to another restaurant at last minute, but luckily I insisted. We all agreed after the trip, this was one of the highlights of our trip. Don't miss it if you can get a reservation!",

        "Review: It's rare for us to find a restaurant that we can truly describe as excellent. Macellaio Roberto Costa makes it simple. If you are a carnivore, you may not want to leave.You might miss it as you walk down Old Brompton Road so look for the red leather sofa outside. Then enter through a narrow passageway with their glassed in butcher's window, butcher's counter and block on your left. The front room is small and intimate several tall tables in front of a cozy (and equally small) bar. The back room is larger, but when all the tables are full (as they are likely to be) there is a similar coziness and intimacy.The staff know their meat and wine. Trust them to recommend. They are professional in appearance and presentation and they know everything about their products. What a pleasant experience to be able to discuss one's preferences and then rely on the staff to fulfil precisely what is discussed. Especially so with Campari spritzers in hand. Our first course consisted of steak tartare, tongue, heart, and liver (all beef). Each dish was excellently prepared and complemented each other.Our main course consisted of a 1.6kg TBone with large filet (4th rib?), 700g ribeye, and a perfectly prepared steak Milanese. The TBone and ribeye were both done medium rare - warm red center and pink to the edge. Not a speck of brown in sight save for the outside charring. In the end, it was a bit too much, but well worth the reasonable prices. The wine pairing was perfect - no wine list needed with the staff's thoughtful recommendation - and, surprise, far from the most expensive wine!Desserts were tasty but not the reason to visit. We declined complimentary after dinner drinks, but what a thoughtful gesture. We have been to all the major steakhouses in London. Macellaio Roberto Costa tops them all in our opinion. Long may they thrive.",

In fact it's referred to in our office as the red sofa place, though until I recently ate there no-one was quite sure what it was, whether it was a butchers, a restaurant or something else. I went with two other colleagues as a goodbye meal for one of them. I let the boys pick the meat and just settled myself down to enjoy the food. And enjoy it I did. While two of us were waiting for the third we received a complimentary selection of smoked thin slices of beef which literally melted in your mouth. The waiter was a little slow at times in seeing to us, but as we had set aside 2 hours for lunch that wasn't too much of a problem. The chef and butcher was brilliant, he helped the guys pick out the steak we wanted - which was huge and split between three of us, and he cooked it to perfection. We did not leave this restaurant hungry...infact we even decided to go all out and have dessert, and wow that was worth it. It's not cheap to eat here, but oh, if you love steak - go for it!",

I was worried before coming to this place for two reasons: first, because it's not easy to find good quality, nicely cooked meat in a restaurant, so I was afraid my boyfriend would be disappointed; second, because I am a vegetarian, so worried that there would be not much for me to eat, and that it would not be nice as it is often the case with vegetarian options in mostly-meat restaurants. However, we were both instead very happy with the experience. My boyfriend absolutely loved both his meat appetisers and main course. The meat was very high quality and cooked perfectly. The presentation of the plates was also very pretty. My cheese starter (stracciatella) and my main (homemade gnocchi) were also delicious. Desserts were latte fritto for me and tiramisu for my boyfriend, and they were among the nicest things we ever had in London. The interior and atmosphere were also cool , and service excellent, with a very friendly waiter. We'll definitely come back for the next special occasion.",

The d\u00e9cor is simple and has a real feeling of family dining rather than up-market chic. You are made to feel comfortable and welcome. Eating here is about meat, especially 'T' bone steaks which are on show, so you can see what you're getting beforehand. The vegetable side dishes were, again, simple and straightforward, but tasty. The espresso was mind-bendingly strong - lovely. Desserts were not as good as other courses, almost an afterthought. Price was ok for London. Very busy place to so recommend booking.",

We had to walk in and explore and found this place is an Italian meat market and a restaurant. They had room for us the next night so made reservations. So glad we did as we were rewarded to some of the finest Italian style steak, something near and dear to me. I have spent a lot of time in Italy dining in and out and cooking the huge Chianina porter house steak. Love it seared rare with EVOO and crunchy salt. This restaurant serves aged Fassone beef imported from Italy and it is some of the finest steak available and cooked to perfection with wonderful sides. A great and not absurdly marked up wine list made this a location to never miss while in London. This is the real deal. Way over exceeded my expectation. Bravo!",

        "Review: We had dinner there on a Thursday night - overall, a poor experience. We booked a table, and we got it almost half an hour late. Then, it took another long while for our order to be collected and the food to be served: the appetizer arrived with the main course, the potatoes were cold, and one main course had been completely forgotten; by the time we got everything that we wanted, I was hungry and tired. The waiter tried to make up for the delay by not making me pay for the steak, which was appreciated but too late. At the tables around me I could see waiters dropping stuff all the time or bringing other clients their dessert, only to snatch it away from them while they were digging in with their spoons - leaving everybody in the room puzzled: wrong order? Food gone bad? The meat was good, however the portions were rather small. If one combined the size of the steak with the fact that it had not been trimmed for the part that had remained exposed to air in the aging process, which resulted in an unusual taste, one would think that the kitchen had been trying to skimp on everything.Finally, the restaurant was furnished with butcher shop bric-a-brac, but evertyhing was a little dusty and a little dirty, providing the coherent undertone to the style of the house.So, problems with service and with quality. Pity, as the concept behind the restaurant is good and with potential.",

We did not eat our prime rib (cut to order) main course, but took a \"doggy\" bag.. Nor did we have desert or coffee .We went straight home and both experienced food poisoning symptoms. I have since informed the Food Agency in London (as anyone in this situation should) and the restaurant management (via email). I have not received any response from the restaurant. Obviously, they feel dinning with them is the patron's own gamble. I can only conclude that there has been a lapse in their hygiene as the restaurant prides itself on it meat quality.

It was the tail end of a side so while we saw the piece we expected that the dried out surface (which is very hard, \"dry-burnt\" and not edible) would be cut out, but low and behold it was cooked and served! The meat was well cooked and tender but somehow not flavorful enough to make it excellent, which it should be in a meat-dedicated restaurant. The chips were very, very good and the caponata and roast vegetables also good but did not leave us wanting to repeat.",

We shared a 1kg tbone which was a fantastic piece of meat perfectly cooked and seasoned.Service was friendly, efficient and helpful. Plenty of red wine to choose from. Busy on a saturday night but we booked on the day. Prices were sensible considering location and quality of the meat.

All is rounded up by very friendly and efficient waitresses. The place looks more like a butcher's store from outside, and tables are lined up in two small rooms that follow. Nothing fancy about decoration, in fact even on the basic side.

In the meanwhile without ask nothing i had a new glass of wine from the barman red wine,if i'm not wrong was Barolo and i had two of those! No space for dessert but 2 glasses of fantastic grappa barrique!! Amazing place and perfect knowledge of the staff, all the guys and girls were smiling,different style unique place!!

        "Review: While enjoying a glass of wine in a wine bar 3 doors over from Maxela - the Manager asked us if we had enjoyed any awesome steak while in London? The next thing you know he is walking us in to Maxela & securing a table for us with the Manager. Soon we were enjoying some of the most amazing tartar & cheese! The most wonderful thing about the experience was that we were sitting right next to the butcher who prepared it! He then suggested we enjoy one of their larger cuts of steak which is prepared in an EXTREMELY HOT oven and carved after resting. I also helped him cut our steak - which was pretty cool! Needless to say this delicious beef will MELT in your MOUTH! A very different type of atmosphere but VERY fun! Everyone who works here is also having FUN! If you are in London & want a wonderful piece of BEEF - go to Maxela! BOOM!",

        "Review: Having visited once before I was impressed with the Tiagliate option on the menu so arranged a family meal on Sunday 4th May with my brother and sister who had flown over from Australia to visit. Whilst not very busy we were crowded into an area with a family including a small child which spent the whole time making so much noise to demand attention we, as a family, could not speak to each other most of the time. The server could not give a toss.Our request for water was met with 2 500ml bottles for the 7 of us and after proceeding to open the wine our server announced that most of the specials where off the menu before he went off to have a dance to the music forced on the diners in the area. After i had sold the various supposed benefits of the menu our server then came over to say that according to the chief 'they were off the menu'. At this point I would have usually got up and left as 'pasta and burger' was not really why we had visited but we pressed on to be ignored by staff who where rude and indifferent with more interesting in 'playing the music loud' for their own benefit that recognising a family get together was being drowned out.At no point was I (or anybody) else approached to see if we where happy and adding a 10% service charge to the bill at the end left me with either creating a scene or just moving on and warning others that complacency has set in, of which I choose the later as whilst hitting the issues head on would have been my preference it would have been unfair to my guests to have been party to quite how I felt about the arrogant, shoddy, indifferent this establishment has shown when it thinks it can get 'anyway' with it.",

My son was excited about it. The restaurant was quite full and we were lucky to be offered a table at the basement which was cosy.The manager, Samuel was helpful in recommending their signature dishes: pesto sauce, beef from Italy..... He was friendly and passionate about what they offered but not pushy at all. We got to pick the dishes we like. We had the homemade pasta with pesto sauce, which was divine. Beef rib was done to perfection, with just olive oil, salt and pepper. We finished 1.2 kg without problem. Side dishes were roasted potato and green salad. The only dish we could not finish was the roast potato as it was big.We surely will return and recommend to our friends. Thumbs up.Overall, very enjoyable and tasty.",

However it comes with many caveats: there is a limited choice of starters and desserts; no side dishes included. The pieces of meat look huge in the first place but a lot of it is bone and fat. Service is on the pushy side - and not included, making the bill pretty hefty in the end (in excess of \u00a350 per head for a rather basic dinner). There are many possibilities to have more fun and eat well for the same price in London (unless you are craving for meat...)",

        "Review: I have been to Maxela three times. The first two times I had really positive food experiences. My third visit was an extreme disappointment. The first bad sign was when my wife called to request a table in the back, where it is 'less' noisy. On the phone the young man gave her a bit of hassle then told that Maxela is not the 'Cipriani' and that she should expect some noise. At dinner, the waiter was not very attentive, we waited an extremely long time, for the main course to arrive (50min or more) even though we were fairly early seated in the evening. When my dish came I had to send it back; the meat was incredibly tough and difficult to cut with the very sharp steak knife, furthermore it was cold. I have never sent food back before. Ever! I never thought that I would receive cold tough meat from a meat specialist, from Piemonte? I am an Italophile when it comes to food, I found the lack of consistency a huge disappointment! Furthermore the waiter was quite unprofessional, he seemed personally annoyed that I sent the dish back, and afterwards he seemed to make himself even less available to us than previously. He did kindly accept our tip for his bad service. When the bill came he kindly explained that we did not pay for the dish that I sent back (the one I did not eat nor reordered). He explained that could not reprint a receipt because there was no manager on duty, therefore he crossed out the costs on the receipt with a ball point pen. I thought he was really taking a liberty, and he dis not leave me any incentive to come again. So much for repeat business.I would say that all of the unprofessional horse play by the staff leaves one cold. I do not come to listen to the staff's bad music selections or watch them horse around with their mates, I am there for the food and to chat with My friends. When the wait staff act like they are the ones on show I believe this restaurant will be there a only short while. I can honestly say the staff would never behave like this if they were in Italy!!I will not return, nor recommend it to friends, although they may have a good experience, they may not...and well London is full of reliably good places to go time after time, where one is treated well.",

        "Review: It was the last day of my trip to Europe and I decided to try out Maxela which was recommended by a blogger. The atmosphere inside was nice and we were serviced nicely at first by a young gentlemen. We didn't book a table so we were given two choices, either sit at a nice table for two, but give the table back after one hour, or, sit at the bar table and we could stay however long we wanted. So we chose the bar table. The butcher ( who was also the cook) recommended some amazingly nice dishes (beef tartare) and cooked the beef to perfection! He was also talkative and we enjoyed our dinner with his company. HOWEVER, We ordered red wine ( with the meat. DUH) but was given white wine. When we told the female staff who we actually wanted red, she rolled her eyes with a ' wat the fxxx' face and just walked away rudely. LASTLY ( the WORST part of our dinner), when my friend requested for the bill, the female staff ( wasn't in uniform. and at times walked around to check on every table and offered only SOME tables bread, i wonder why?? discrimination against looks? clothing? age?? race??) asked her a question with a strong italian accent but my friend couldn't hear her ( cuz it was noisy in the restaurant) after she repeated it for two times, she simply rolled her eyes and waived her hands rudely and walked away with this ' oh my god, why are these people here, let me just get the bill so they can leave FASTER' expression. So overall, the food was really good, but the restaurant could be better without this horrible woman who doesn't understand the basics of SERVICE.",

        "Review: I have been to Maxela a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed however I went back last week because friends booked there..The idea behind the restaurant (the butcher that sells and cooks the meat) is not bad but the implementation is poor.Food : the quality of the meat is very good however once again the \"tagliata\" arrived at our table after a long wait and it was warmish. This is a huge mistake and it is not a coincidence because happened twice in 2 months. In Italy the \"tagliata\" is served in dishes that are boiling hot in order to preserve the temperature of the meat. This guys don't know the basic rules of cooking and serving meat.The presentation was also very poor, the meat comes without any side in an empty(cold) dish. Put some salad, or potatos, or something.Service: The service is very bad - either they come 3 times to ask you the same thingh or they just ignore you. Also the Chef should stay in the kitchen instead of walking around the tables and chat with everyone. He came to out table and took our orders, he wan't even listening to us and he didn't write anything. Of course the order was wrong and we didnt get what we ordered.The athmosphere is lively and informal, however the croud was not right. A lot of people shouting, bad and loud music.Price : being ion South Ken doesn't justify the high price if you don't deliver. Overpriced food & wine",

        "Review: Recommended by an Italian friend who said Maxela opening in London stopped him returning to Rome so frustrated was he by the lack of good beef in London. With so many London establishments presenting themselves as steak restaurants Maxela leaves them standing not only on the quality of the beef - all from Italy, aged and from the sweeter grass fed meat of heffers - but also in how it is cooked in their 400 degree specially made ovens. Leelo, their Neapolitan in house butcher, presides behind his counter of magnificent & huge cuts of beef. He happily and knowledgeably talks you through them all & made good recommendations. A great education. The aged rib eye was cooked perfectly with simply rock salt and oil and was incredibly tender with terrific flavour. This followed the Tagliere Imperiale (a sharing butcher's board of salami, lardo, bresaola and two steak tartares and Burrata cheese). The wine suggested was very good. There was little room for side orders of vegetables - I would suggest just a green salad as the emphasis is on the generous servings if beef. We did not have pudding as there was no room for it and the selection was surprisingly limited. Definitely a great place to go if you want superb beef in a lively but naturally enthusiastic Italian setting. Roberto the owner has a hands on approach and the staff were all helpful and efficient. It is a third visit and a great local favourite now. ",

Ho voluto regalargli questo \"pezzo d'Italia\" a Londra viste anche le ottime recensioni qui su TripAdvisor. Devo dire che le aspettative non sono state tradite, anzi. Abbiamo cominciato con un ottimo antipasto a base di stracciatella e misto di salumi (lardo, bresaola e salame con bruschette condite con verdure grigliate). Vivendo da qualche mese in UK, assaggiare di nuovo prodotti tipici italiani italiani (e non il solito falsume inglese) \u00e8 stato magnifico, il tutto aiutato dalla gentilezza nel consigliarci di Emanuele. Abbiamo preso poi due tagliate, una con lardo e saut\u00e9 di cipolle e un'altra con gorgonzola e noci. Piccolo appunto su quest'ultima, forse un po' troppo gorgonzola che magari pu\u00f2 infastidire chi non \u00e8 abituato a questi sapori.Per completare, avevo inviato nelle note della prenotazione una richiesta: fetta di torta con candelina per festeggiare il compleanno del mio ragazzo.

Excellent starters, I recommend the Battuta and Steak Tartare; marinated in olive oil, they feel as pure and tasty as anything that I ve tried recently.For main, I would suggest the Costata (ribeye steak), although it would be a good idea to ask the staff for what they would suggest on the day.Only very small negative point I would make is that the quality of the meat we ordered was slightly variable in a few cases; sometimes better that other times.Thoroughly recommend a visit!",

Both were presented and cooked to perfection. The staff and the owner were genuinely interested to hear opinion of the food. Maxela is an absolute dream for meat lovers and the particular aspect of it is that it serves very tender meat (Fassone beef) from Northern Italy. It was very stimulating to see an Italian restaurant that specialises in a less known aspect of Italian food instead of serving the usual pasta. The bread was obviously home baked and delicious. Very good wine list designed to complement the food. The tiramisu was nice in both presentation and taste, although the coffee taste could have been a bit stronger.Maxela is clearly a restaurant and a very special butchery I will be happy to return to.",

Il mio ragazzo ed io accettiamo e fin dall'ingresso nel ristorante l'atmosfera e i ragazzi dello staff si rivelano allegri e accoglienti. Il banco della macelleria \u00e8 proprio di fronte al nostro tavolo e questo ci permette di osservare la preparazione dei piatti e percepire la passione con la quale questi ragazzi servono i loro prodotti. Abbiamo mangiato un antipasto chiamato Il piatto del re, composto da ottimi salumi, burrata e battuto di carne cruda, di-vi-no. Ci hanno poi consigliato una fiorentina di Fassona: la cottura al sangue era perfetta e la carne si scioglieva in bocca.. come nei migliori ristoranti del nostro paese!! Il tutto naturalmente accompagnato da ottimo vino rosso italiano..Italiani che vivete l\u00ec o che passate per viaggio o lavoro, vi consiglio di prenotare una cenetta in questo locale (prenotazione anche on line). Il costo, non \u00e8 proprio a buon mercato, ma vale assolutamente la serata!!",

        "Review: Sono spesso all'estero per lavoro e di solito preferisco mangiare la cucina locale. Spesso per\u00f2 mi trattengo qualche settimana e qualche volta una cena italica non mi dispiace. A Londra c'\u00e8 una vastissima scelta ma spesso i piatti sono \"anglosassonizzati\" (scusate il termine). Con piacere mi sono imbattuto in questo ristorante e ho avuto modo passando di parlare con i proprietari(due simpatici genovesi) che mi hanno convinto a rimanere a cena. E' stata una bellissima esperienza a base di carne di fassone piemontese. Non conoscevo questo ristorante, che poi ho saputo \u00e8 presente in varie citt\u00e0 italiane, ma adesso lo considero una ottima integrazione alla mia dieta londinese. Vale la pena provare.",

Some hand cut chips as side.The cured meat was nice, but the best steak I ever ever had, was the Filetto. Amazing top quality and cooked right with some rock salt and served on top of some fresh rosemary branches...The fries were a bit so so.

We had ordered a separate side dish to our meat, however they served us the meat without the side dish. We asked the waiter about our side dish and he advised us that it was on its way. We waited for a while but started eating the meat because it was getting cold. We asked for it againa and we eventually asked the waiter to cancel our side dish and he was fine about it however about five minute later (when we had finished all our dishes) the manager comes and serves us the side order. We advise him that we had cancelled the order as we had waited for a while and had finsihed our meal. His reaction was certainly not what we expected from a grown man. He went on to kick the floor board and stormed off, as if we had committed a crime.... very strange. We were quite shocked to say the least. We tried to explain our disappointment to no avail. Unfortunately because of this incident the evening was somewhat tainted especially as the final bill was just over \u00a3200.00 so we would expect some level of service for this level of restaurant. We didnt have any apologies which would have certainly made everything better. Some may say that the service is less important however for me and my friends it is an important part to our experience.

Yes, it is Italian cuisine, but only to the extent that it is really a glorious Tuscan steakhouse. Unless one is an unabashed carnivore, there is no reason to dine here....but, if delicious beef is one's \"thing,\" it would be hard to do better. One immediately encounters the abundantly stocked raw beef showcase upon entering, behind which the wonderfully affable butcher, Lello (Rafaele) plies his skills and offers expert ordering advice. What follows is more than a delicious dining experience. The entire staff, Vincenzo, Georgia, and several others work in concert to provide warmth and humor in what might be described as the polar opposite of a stuffy dining experience.

A seguire una cacio e pepe ottima, di cui ho apprezzato la perfetta cottura al dente della pasta. Ed infine il pezzo forte: una costata di manzo frollata. Pi\u00f9 di un kg di carne che letteralmente si scioglie in bocca!! Il tutto accompagnato da un azzecato vino della regione delle dolomiti di cui nn ricordo il nome, consigliatomi dal maitre il quale mi ha accopagnato nella scelte delle portate, con tanto di spiegazione sull'origine di ogni prodotto.

        "Review: I only went once in a Maxela restaurant in Italy, and i can remember it as a very nice experience, but when I accidentally met Maxela in South Kensington it took a second to get in..what an amazing sight! All these stunning meat out there! Who doesn't think \" i want some??\".So i got in and i met Roberto, who welcomed me and my friends just like we were old aged friends, a very nice person. After a minute I met the manager, Samuele, who took us and brought us to the meat and made us try all of the salame and breasola and that outstanding lard that i just used to dream in London! But then the strangest thing happened: they cut a very small piece of ribeye steak and made me try just the way it was,raw. It was so good, so fruity! We've had as starter a mix of raw meat, so amazing! And then, after the very good assistance of the waiters (and the very nice girl bartender) we took a ribeye( cooked but not too much!), a t bone steak and an \"elephant ear\"..magic! Ribeye steak cooked alla milanese..amazing!After a few bottles of a very good red wine suggested by the guys, we had amazing desserts such as tiramisu, and a quite heavy but worth of everypound the \"latte dolce fritto\"!Very nice experience, really looking forward to come back! And as you say, nice to meat you!",

        "Review: Sono stata in questo ristorante su consiglio di amici e devo dire che sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa! L'atmosfera \u00e8 accogliente e \"calda\", grazie anche al giovane proprietario che \u00e8 molto simpatico e cordiale; il cibo di ottima qualit\u00e0...insomma \u00e8 come sentirsi a casa propria pur stando all'estero! Abbiamo preso un primo piatto (fettucine al pesto) davvero squisito, una vera rarit\u00e0 in una citt\u00e0 straniera; poi tutti secondi piatti conditi in modo davvero ottimo e particolare (come la tagliata noci e gorgonzola e quella alle pere), nei quali non si pu\u00f2 non notare l'ottima qualit\u00e0 della carne; e poi contorni di verdure. Ottimo anche il loro tiramis\u00f9. L'unico piccolo \"difetto\" \u00e8 che le porzioni non sono molto abbondanti, ma vi \u00e8 il pregio di poter assaggiare molte cose senza uscire appesantiti. Il locale \u00e8 molto carino, con un ampio banco della carne all'entrata e un vasto lucernario nella sala principale. I prezzi sono assolutamente nella norma per una citt\u00e0 cara come Londra, soprattutto considerata l'ottima qualit\u00e0 del cibo. Lo consiglio assolutamente a tutti.",

        "Review: Viaggio spesso per lavoro a Londra, e tendo spesso a visitare ristoranti etnici che l\u00ec possono essere davvero ottimi. Un amico mi ha portato in questo nuovo ristorante italiano a South Kensington, e nonostante il mio pregiudizio iniziale - andare a mangiare italiano a Londra... - ho dovuto ricredermi. Grandi carni, frollate al punto giusto, contorni mica male e primi molto buoni. Cantina dei vini interessante, con punte eccellenti. Il tutto con prezzi onesti - al confronto con quelli pazzeschi cui sono abituato a Londra. Ma quello che pi\u00f9 mi \u00e8 piaciuto \u00e8 l'atmosfera del locale, sembra di essere nella cantina di una fattoria del Chianti, e mi trovavo in Old Brompton Road. Non che io non sia goloso, ma anche l'occhio...Servizio puntuale e professionale, si vede che i ragazzi che ti servono sanno quello che fanno e sono fieri del loro ristorante.

        "Review: Ho trovato questo ristorante sulla pagina Facebook del Gambero Rosso, ho guardato il sito e ho deciso subito di prenotare tramite Top Table per il nostro piccolo viaggio a Londra ed \u00e8 stata un'ottima decisione. Il locale \u00e8 a South Kensington, quartiere chic della metropoli, riconoscibile per il banco della macelleria..in vetrina! Siamo entrati e ci siamo accorti di essere tornati in Italia! Appena lo staff ha capito la nostra nazionalit\u00e0 siamo stati accolti con ancora pi\u00f9 gentilezza e calore, siamo stati accompagnati nella saletta dietro la macelleria (!!) e subito il ma\u00eetre \u00e8 arrivato per fare la nostra conoscenza, erano quasi stupiti, la loro clientela tipo credo non sia il turista italiano, ma l'inglese appassionato di carne e di cibi..liguri! Infatti sul men\u00f9 c'erano minestrone alla genovese e taglierini al pesto.. Oltre a carne cotta e cruda! Noi avevamo gi\u00e0 studiato il men\u00f9 quindi abbiamo preso: tagliata con rucola e ricotta salata, polpette con patate e hamburger con lardo e miele. Tutto ottimo, ma un piccolo appunto devo farlo sui contorni, scarsi e sembravano riscaldati, le patate arrosto erano molli c'\u00e8, come se fossero state cotte in precedenza e poi scaldate, peccato. Abbiamo bevuto birra, Nastro Azzurro che ci hanno detto di gran moda in UK, e acqua gassata. Il conto era sui 45 pounds, le porzioni abbondanti, l'ambiente ottimo. Ci hanno detto di avere ristoranti in Italia, anche a Genova e Milano, quindi credo che prover\u00f2 anche quelli. Un apprezzamento allo staff, cordiale, ma non eccessivo.",

        "Review: We found Maxela by walking along Old Brompton Road - we were intrigued by the combo of an Italian butchers and restaurants. We checked out some reviews and booked a table for a Sunday night. We were initially disappointed because the waiter was a little difficult for us to understand and vice versa, leading to confusion over our choice of a meat and bread platter. Also the chianti we wanted wasn't available. However the alternative wine suggestion turned out to be lovely, if \u00a310 more expensive. We both choose Tagilere dishes (strips of Fassone steak) for main course, which was delicious, if a little chewy in places. The highlight of the meal though were the desserts - deep fried sweet milk (with nutella or sugar) and chocolate torte. Both were superb desserts, not too heavy and very tasty.",

We walked in tonight (friday) without a booking, and were greeted by a very friendly waiter who assured us that in the next 15 minutes a table would be free, and we could seat at the bar while we waited. The wine list is small, but provides a good choicE of wine ranging from 25 to 100 GBP. We had a platter of excellent quality cold cuts while waiting. The food was good quality throughout - both the pasta dish and the meat were very good, and the dessert (fried sweet milk) was absolutely amazing. Service is very friendly (it helps if you speak italian, but you dont have too). The one piece of advice is to try and seat in the front vs back room... we were at the front for drinks before dinner, and at the backfor dinner: the back is way too noisy and at times we could not hear each other.

You chose the cut of meat you would like along with the weight and it is then cooked to your liking. The staff were very attentive helping us decide on which cut of meat to have, advising the difference between the cuts and the aging of each cut. They also recommended a wonderful wine which complimented our lunch perfectly. We chose to have a 1kg ribeye aged to 45 days along with roast potatoes and grilled vegetables for 2 people which was plenty. As the meat was cut we were offered a taste before it was taken to the kitchen to be cooked, it was like nothing I'd eaten before, truly outstanding. It was served to our table already carved and cooked to perfection. The taste and texture was divine and I can say hand on heart, it was the tastiest steak I have ever eaten and I've eaten a lot! We couldn't leave without tasting the home made tiramisu which was again outstanding. Needless to say, a visit to this restaurant is a must for any meat lovers, vegetarians beware!",

I had checked them out online beforehand and looked at their site (which also needs improvement) which really doesn't do the space justice.The concept is great, pick your cut of meat and order it as you like it cooked. I choose the braesola to start which was very nice, my partner ordered minestrone but a vegetable soup arrived, we questioned whether it was minestrone (it wasn't) but we were assured that it was.Mains arrived, I ordered sirloin which was badly cooked and unfortunately not a great cut. My partner ordered a rump which he was really looking forward to-it arrived cut up into strips and not cooked to his liking so we sent it back. The wait staff brought it back without query. While the experience was an enjoyable one, I think they need to really concentrate on their menu and how it is presented to the diners. A restaurant like this which specialises in meat really needs to be able to cook it and present it as it's ordered. It has great potential and I hope it does well. The staff were very pleasant but I think they need to focus on what's important. The food.I wish them luck. ",
