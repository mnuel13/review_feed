        "Review: Never again! Went for friends birthday last night slow service took ages to get a drink and then we were given bread not even asked and later saw it was on the bill but two lots when we only got one.. the tuna unavailable on the starters.. no sauces available for the steaks! Nor the correct cheese for the burrata so it was substituted for mozzarella but no alteration to the bill! I ordered the prawn tagliatelle-sure it didn\u2019t even have any whole prawns it was chopped up bits of prawn maybe 2 and that was \u00a318! I was still hungry.. steaks were different sizes even though they were supposed to be the same! Massively overpriced for what it was, it was only because it was my friends birthday we didn\u2019t want to kick up too much fuss but we will never go there again! I feel massively ripped off! Just come back from Italy too and I have to say it didn\u2019t even compare.. disappointing avoid!!",

We order a pasta ( for my bf) and a roast baby chicken (for me). Pasta arrived a bit before my chicken but whatever. When I got my chicken I realized it was completely raw and pink inside. When I\u2019ve told the waitress she was very sorry and she apologized saying that she would take the chicken back to the kitchen. After 15 minutes of waiting she came back saying that the chicken would take 20 more minutes to cook so she asked me if I wanted something else. At the moment I was starving and my boyfriend had already finished his pasta so I asked her for the quickest main. She came back with a tagliata which was good. We were then charged for the all cost of the meal ( the tagliata of course was more expensive than the chicken) despite they serving me a raw chicken and us having eaten at different times but it was 50% off for the eat out scheme so didn\u2019t complain. Very disappointing experience.",

It has steak tartare, battuta all'albese, carpaccio, bresaola, cooked ham, salame and stracciatella.If I could make to love to something, this would be it!It is quite large and can easily be shared between four people. We then had a rib-eye steak with some roast potatoes and spinach. Well, what can I say about that steak... I STILL dream about it after four days!Our waitress Anita was incredibly nice, she anticipated all our needs and brilliantly explained why Fassona is so much better compared to other types of beef.We finished the meal off with some tiramisu \u2013 which was also delicious!I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be back!",

        "Review: Please read this in the light-hearted tone in which it is intended; nothing personal against the charming and obliging staff is implied nor should be inferred.The regular 3 of us dropped by here on spec on Sunday 5th May intending to pass 30mins with a bottle of wine until Numero Uno opposite was up & running for the early evening. However, it seemed a nice ambience and the apparently complimentary plate of charcuterie pressed on us persuaded us to stay on for dinner.Unfortunately this place is in a chain (S. Ken, Clerkenwell, Bankside) that considers it necessary to have a \"Concept\", which the poor staff is obliged to explain.As this Concept unfolded, it became apparent that it mainly revolves around the fact that \"Chef\" will not cook the meat how you like it. It further transpired that the cutlery is removed, only to be returned by carefully placing the fork, then spearing the steak-knife into the table-top from a distance. It also involves already-dated-looking slates on boards.We felt it necessary to explain OUR concept: WE're paying - a Lot (see below) - so we'd like it at least medium-rare, please, or at least not so bloody that we had real health & safety concerns about the inch-thick lamb leg-steaks which despite this were not tender or especially tasty and the two of us simply gave up through a mixture of boredom and hard work cutting the meat. Our friend fared better with the rare filet steak.We'd also like clean crockery next time rather than re-used slates 'n' boards, ta.At \u00a3163-odd for 3 including 2 bottles of red, it wasn't a cheap experiment, so:Short Version - Unless you're a tiresome pass\u00e9 alpha-male who bores on about raw meat or you want to re-create the closing credits sequence of The Flintstones, content yourself with a few antipasti and a bottle one of the excellent nobiles.",

It is simply furnished - rustic, but comfortable none the less.The menu is beef orientated, an amazing array of cuts. (Chicken and intriguingly rabbit made it to the menu, but given the focus it seemed churlish to choose anything but beef). Orders taken our waitress (helpful and knowledgeable on the cuts, sourcing etc.) returned with the appropriate cutlery. The steak knives were driven into the table like a medieval banquet.My friend and I shared a couple of starters - which were good.For my main I had a hanger steak rubbed with herbs and 'smoke'. Thought this was a bit of a gimmick but no. My meal arrived under an opaque dome, which when lifted was indeed smoke. Wonderfully theatrical, wonderfully tasty. Probably the best stake I've ever had.

        "Review: Its speciality are steaks, which you chose raw and they cook. The steaks are priced by raw uncooked weight (so you need more than you think) and, having agreed a weight, the steak they brought to the table for our approval was a bit heavier than we were recommended - funny that. Sides are not included and are \u00a34.90 extra each. To its credit, the T-bone steak was superbly cooked and the battuta zola starter was out of this world. There is plenty of non-steak choice which is reasonably priced. The wine list is pricey and a 12.5% service charge is added. Ultra efficient manager held the service together because his waiting staff were clueless, comically so. A fun and original concept but, for what it is, pricey. Small number of covers won\u2019t help the per capita economics, but it does make for a cosy atmosphere. ",

        "Review: Friendly welcoming and knowledgable staff but food was disappointing and lacked flavour. We had croquettes to start with that were incredibly bland and tasteless.I had a ribeye steak that for some reason came cut up. The meat was bland and underwhelming. The staff seemed proud to say the meat has nearly no fat in it. This is not what makes steak tasty, so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be proud of that. The steak wasn\u2019t even flame grilled. REALLY disappointing especially for a \u00a330 steak. My partner had a ragu pasta that also simply lacked depth and flavour. Tasted very two dimensional. I also order a glass of wine at \u00a311 that was well below a standard 175ml glass. Very underwhelmed for a pricey meal. Avoid. ",

        "Title: Un grande ristorante italiano senza pizza e mandolino",
        "Review: In questo ottimo ristorante si mangia della vera cucina italiana.Non \u00e8 la classica cucina di pasta e pizza ma si trova dell'ottima carne, fiorentine e tagliate oltre a pochi primi selezionati.Assaggiate i ravioli al brasato sono eccezionali saporiti e con un vero sugo, non di carne trita ma di carne cotta e insaporita per ore che si scioglie in bocca. Le tagliatelle sono un pochino spesse ma il sugo \u00e8 veramente buono.La tartare, su un letto di cipolle, o la pi\u00f9 semplice battuta di fassona sono semplicemente deliziose, per la qualit\u00e0 e il trattamento della materia prima.Ho evitato le tagliate pi\u00f9 elaborate con gorgonzola e vari condimenti, pi\u00f9 adatti al mercato inglese, per ripiegare su quella semplice all'olio e sale grosso, la cottura era un po meno che media ma la carne era tenerissima.Carta dei vini molto buona, abbiamo bevuto un barbera onesto ad un prezzo accettabile.Non si spende pochissimo ma le materie prime sono di qualit\u00e0.Eravamo con due bambini piccoli che sono stati vezzeggiati da tutto il personale.Per sottofondo compilation di musica italiana anni dal 70 in poi.",

So far so good.Then I look toward the kitchen pass and notice a young member of staff, he was looking at us and mumbling words in ITALIAN, unfortunately for him I am also italian and I understood everything he said, he was really rude and vulgar towards us. We being called DIC.....DS and we were blamed to disturb him during a quite time.I couldn't believe my ears, I guess if you cannot stand people coming to your restaurant to spend money you should try a different job as in the hospitality there is lots of interaction with people.I got really angry and told him that I speak italian, I may have told him off in a fashionable way (apologies for that), then we left.The manager looked truly sorry but I guess hour pre-dinner drink got spoiled.Shame, the restaurant looks great and the reviews were all positive, unfortunately I will never have a chance to try after this appalling experience.",

        "Review: Went for dinner at Macellaio on the basis of recommendations of the South Ken branch.Firstly, the location. The restaurant is towards the far end of Northcote Rd and is a long way from the bustle near Battersea Rise.The Smell: I appreciate that this is a steak restaurant, but I do not want to be overwhelmed by the smell of meat as I sit at my table, it is more pungent than the Doves butcher not too far away and was intensified as the staff pulled in more meet from the window display, it actually put me off my food.The Food: Whilst the food in principal was good, there has be a a question to the logic of offering a 1.6kg rib and then trying to cook it with the bone on - the centre was rare, which was delicious, but the outside retained the texture of biltong from the hanging process, it appeared not to have been pan fried at all - a bit of a disappointment. The starters and puddings were good though.Service: Not particularly good, it started well but given there were only 3 tables including ours, it seemed very slow and stilted.The price: for \u00a375 I would expect a little more. There are better options in the immediate vicinity, including Roxy that would be 30% cheaper. Overall: I was expecting far more from a chain which is held in such high regard. I do not expect to return any time soon and I would chose Roxy over Macellaio every time. That said, I hope this was a one off and other diners have had better a experience, especially the over powering smell of raw blood and beef.",

From the beginning the service was impeccable (young Italian lady with brown hair - cant remember her name!) from offering Aperitifs to helping us decide on the cut of meat and wine to pair it with. We ordered the croquettes which were delicious, but the charcuterie board with the pezzo di lardo paired with honey and walnut was sublime! With three hungry guys on the table, they ordered 1.5kg of the T-Bone which tasted (i nicked a little bit) amazing, the flavours was so intense and definitely worth while. The other three had two ribeye steaks, the Gorgonzola with walnut butter was delicious and so was the chicken - both packed with flavour.There are some expensive wines on the menu, but we opted for a \u00a332 bottle, which did not disappoint. The waitress was great in explaining which wines she thought we would appreciate based on our tastes, and she got it very right!Normally when the food is so good, the desserts to not match up to the standard, however the desserts here are a must. The apple cake, milk and Nutella balls and the cheesecake were also great.Although the food is brilliant, i would have to say, the highlight was our waitress, who managed to entertain the three guys that were joking around with her for the entire evening about French wine and Italian mannerisms.Definitely worth a trip, but make sure you book in advance!",

        "Review: Vado al macellaio di Northcote Road pieno di aspettative: colleghi gourmet che hanno visitato il ristorante di South Kensington me me parlano in termini semplicemente entusiastici.La prima piccola delusione arriva quando ci accomodiamo: l'arredamento non sembra molto curato, i tavoli sono microscopici e infatti mangiare sar\u00e0 un'impresa.. mah, mi dico, hanno aperto da poco e lo spazio a Londra costa caro si sa..Il men\u00f9 invece \u00e8 un capolavoro di essenzialit\u00e0: non troppi piatti, eppure hai la sensazione che non manchi niente tra antipasti, primi e soprattutto carne.Fantastica la carta dei vini, naturalmente tutta italiana, con prevalenza di Toscana e Piemonte come forse si addice ad un locale specializzato in carne.Servizio cortese e professionale, tutto italiano, con tanto di entratina offerta (una focaccia in po' triste e qualche fetta di buon salame).Ma veniamo alla carne. Ordiniamo una rump steak all gorgonzola e noci e una skirt steak in salsa di funghi e parsnip croccanti.La rump \u00e8 molta buona, grigliata alla perfezione e perfettamente rispettosa della cottura richiesta, il gorgonzola \u00e8 solo un piccolo pezzetto a lato con UNA noce (mi aspettavo una salsa). La skirt steak invece \u00e8 cotta lentamente in sottovuoto (o sous vide come in maniera molto posh mi spiegano), ma la consistenza resta ahim\u00e8 un po' gommosa e la salsa non troppo riuscita per i miei gusti. Per completare, un'insalata di cavolo rosso con guanciale croccante e un bicchiere di Etna Rosso (migliorato notevolmente dall'apertura della bottiglia a una decina di minuti dopo).Il conto \u00e8 di \u00a350 in due, che in principio ci sta, ma quello che ci ha stupito \u00e8 la dimensione delle porzioni. Una rump da \u00a316 da si e no 100 gr, per quanto di carne italianissima (lo do per scontato), resta un prezzo un po' alto anche per Londra per un main che ti lascia comunque un po' affamato. Ma insomma anche il resto \u00e8 tarato al rialzo: la pi\u00f9 modesta skirt steak costava comunque intorno ai \u00a315, l'insalata addirittura \u00a34.90, i vini al calice mediamente \u00a38-10 (calice piccolo). Servizio del 12.5% obbligatorio anche per tavoli piccoli.La sensazione finale \u00e8 di aver mangiato bene, ma non in maniera eccezionale, e di aver pagato un po' troppo.

        "Review: We arrived on time at 630pm on a Friday evening, having been informed when we made booking we would have to give up the table at 830pm. I have never warmed to this concept of two sittings of an evening and more often than not, do not book a table if it is a pricey restaurant. On this occasion I was not the one making the booking.We had a cosy, quiet table towards to the rear close to the bar, it is not a big place but the tables are set apart comfortably. The staff were absolutely lovely, attentive and very friendly. We ordered a good variety of starters and were also given a tray of mortadella and well made bread. The steak tartare was exceptional, as was the liver cooked in butter and sage and also the testicles sauteed in lard. We had a a couple of carafes of fine red and an excellent sauvignon blanc, wines were pricey but not shockingly so. For mains 3 of us shared a 1kg rib of beef, it was brought to the table prior to cooking and arrived later under a huge silver dome. We ordered several portions of fries, 1 baby chicken and one vegetarian Trenette pasta dish which was nice enough but not exceptional. The red meat was a HUGE hit and devoured. Desserts of fried milk - very good, , tiramasu - ok, chocolate cake - surprisingly very good and an excellent cheeseboard all went down very well. The cheeseboard came with no crackers/bread we had to ask. Something like a Sicilian flatbread would have been a perfect accompaniment. It was an expensive meal but if you like good meat this is definitely worth giving a go. Besides you don't have to go over board, it is easy to order carefully and eat just as well. And to top it all, we were never asked to vacate the table and left when we were ready. A pleasant evening.",

        "Review: I don't eat meat often so when I do I make sure I choose well.The restaurant\u2019s specialty is Fassone beef from Italy which is probably one of the best beef on the block. I was surprised by the carnivorous menu, indeed, as a starter, there were not many choices and we did not want to have charcuteries, steak tartare or carpaccio if we were to enjoy some steak afterward, we, therefore, went for the soup as it was the only vegetarian option. Fortunately, this soup was a delight.The main is a mixture of offals, grilled meat or pasta. I had the rump steak and my friend while the beef shoulder, both dishes were tasty and tender and low in fat, especially the beef shoulder. Additionally, they just serve the right amount so no food was wasted! Our sides were also excellent and my dessert was to die for. On the negative side, our waitress was lovely but did not understand or speak English, so the communication was a bit difficult, also, more starters options should be offered as having meat both for starters and for the main is a bit too much!I would go back and would definitely recommend this place, especially for meat-lovers.",

        "Review: Huge window frames huge chucks of meat and inside there's a delicatessen with a range of cold cuts and steaks. The room is jack packed with tables and chairs so you have to be careful where you go!I arrived for the soft opening and ordered the carpaccio - this was well seasoned no generously portioned and accompanied with a fruity olive oil - simply divine! I ordered some bread (which was a bit stale) but worked to soak the oil and pieces of beef on top. The beef just melts on your mouth - hmmmThe rump steak was already sliced and accompanied with a very limp dish of rocket and Parmesan which I just ignored as it would simply take away from the steak. I also had the French beans with breadcrumbs for texture and the tasty potatoes that were flavoured with rosemary - a very good dish. I think I'll order a slab of steak next time as I prefer to cut my own steak but it's pretty pricy.I finished with a tiramisu which the staff raved on about but I had better, more memorable versions in another restaurant down the same road.As it was a soft opening, the bill was half priced which was very reasonable and I think full priced is fine for the quality of the meat. The staff were lovely and the manager, Alberto took the time to explain different cuts, where the meat was from, etc. He also didn't charge me for the tiramisu to make up for the rocket salad. What I would change is the \"plates\", i.e. The blocks of wood - there's no room to cut your food and sometimes it feels unbalanced. Really annoying!",

Cooked to perfection, my wife said she didnt mind it being on the rare side with meat that good. couple of downsides - the tables in the front are quite narrow - we sat in the middle and got hit several times by handbags and wide hips! not helped by smokers coming in and out. The office is in a small cubby hole with a 100w light bulb - quite off putting late at night when you are enjoying a romantic meal.

A bottle of Spanish red recommended by the waiter was beautiful.My only tiny whine is they don't serve sauces.

        "Review: This is, I think, the fourth Macellaio to have opened in London in recent years, the others being in Old Brompton Road, Clerkenwell and underneath the arches in Union Street, Southwark. This one towards the southern end of Northcote Road replacing Rosina's Sherry Bar (a failure as both a business and a concept) is the closest to our home in Wandsworth. It feels more like a butchers' than a restaurant much of the small space in the front room occupied by a large display case full of raw meat carcasses. Behind a screen blocks the window thus rendering the interior rather gloomy. As part of the soft opening I was expecting it to be much fuller than it was this lunchtime given the Open Table reservations site suggested there were currently no tables available. It majors in steaks. A male couple at another table shared a rib steak cooked on the bone for \u00a330. We were less adventurous. Absent any children's menu my daughter had ravioli with a herby ragu from the main menu. My steak tartare starter lacked seasoning and could have had egg yolk added. Bollita croquettes with chocolate were a tad wacky. It was good to see rabbit on the menu and my wife enjoyed her assorted pieces served on a tray with a yoghurty sauce. My rump steak came unexpectedly sliced. Desserts namely a chocolate slice and a Bianco di Basilica (a sort of Italian take on crema Catalana) were memorable; espressos exemplary. But even with a 50% reduction on food the bill was still in excess of \u00a383, partly because the 500ml carafe of 'house' wine cost \u00a329 whilst portions of chips and roast potatoes were around \u00a35 each. Service was efficient and polite throughout.",

However the service is slick and you couldn't tell it was soft opening week.We were given some amazing complimentary slices of beef which was melt in the mouth and to my relief my date was looking forward to the rest.For starters he had the tatiki which was seared rump steak (absolutely delicious) cooked to perfection. I had the Macellaio salad which was pure heaven. Beautiful ingredients which sang for themselves.For mains we had the rib of beef to share cooked rare. The beef was of superior quality and we were gutted it was finished! Sides were bit of let down. We had some lovely Barbera D.O.C wine which was a perfect accompaniment to the meat. Dessert menu was slightly disappointing. Even with the soft opening offer we paid \u00a3120 for two starters, main, sides and a bottle of wine.

        "Review: The wonderful Concierge Team, Sean & Richard at the nearby Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel, Russell Square highly recommended Macellaio Fitzrovia to us upon our very detailed requirements that we wanted an independent, high-end Italian, that oozed style & Italian authenticity, which was located close-by & within walking distance from the Hotel! Wow wow wow simply sums up Macellaio & it certainly ticked all our boxes! It\u2019s so quirky, quaint, occupying a building which we later understood to be London\u2019s first petrol station & to that end, the Proprietor\u2019s have styled & designed the venue with a clear nod to its\u2019 mechanical history; with cutlery sets being displayed & featured upon long screws & bolts & with the Waiters wearing formula one, Grand Prix-style jumpsuits. Additionally all the table tops feature Italian automotive brands, Fiat, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo etc & some of the seating has been constructed from wooden wine boxes & adorned with funky cushions for style & comfort. It\u2019s entire interior is modern & fun & absolutely immaculately spotless throughout; especially the restroom facilities which is always an indicative test for me! We were welcomed like old Friends, despite having never been before & immediately accommodated, although Sean @ the Kimpton Fitzroy had made an impromptu reservation upon our behalf & it literally took less than ten minutes to stroll across Russell Square through the University buildings to reach Macellaio; whose name & signage is lit up like a west-end show! Other trendy, original aspects of Macellaio were the newspaper-styled menus; such a unique concept & a real show of individuality. Further, we were delighted to have stumbled across happy hour which is actually two hours, 6-8pm for certain drinks priced at just \u00a35 each; so a few Aperol Spritz were enjoyed as we surveyed the menus & absorbed the eclectic venue. We were only in the market for a pasta supper, having enjoyed a huge three course lunch earlier that day at Quaglino\u2019s; but the steaks & carne is without doubt the speciality of this really very special establishment, since it features its\u2019 very own butchery counter displaying all the sustainably & traceable meat in gloriously spectacular cabinets & we can not wait to return to sample the Macellaio specialities. It was a seemingly wonderful experience for Diners to have their respective meat choice presented to them at the table prior to cooking & the pomp & ceremony surrounding the sharing steak with the shiner cloche was a sight to behold & also such a fabulously unique style in which to served Guests. We had the tagliettelle ragu, along with the stuffed ravioli with spinach & ragu, a leaf salad & a pizza-style garlic bread, washed down with a few glasses of red! Perfecto! Everything was beautifully presented & utterly delicious; just exquisite Italian food fayre at its\u2019 finest. Grazie mille all! We will return very soon. X ",

        "Review: A small but super tastefully designed Italian restaurant in Fitzrovia with a very cool concept of dry aged beef and open display kitchen. The service was good and the menu was clean. The variety was just enough not to become confusing in ordering the different yummy varieties on the menu. The quality of food was exceptional and most importantly, very fresh!! The quality of dry-age beef was excellent and prepared in perfection!!The pastas, pizza and ravioli was also exceptional! The ambience is different and warm with different objects hanging from the walls to give a bit of spice to the design.  A reservation is a must as this place gets packed by 9ish pm on a weekend. It\u2019s not a surprise as the quality food and value for money is perfect!",

        "Review: The waiter wears mechanic\u2019s overalls. The barstools have pedals from bicycles, there is a Scalextric on the ceiling?! They have a lovely cabinet full of excellent beef and a pizza oven but failed to make Tartare or pizza to an acceptable standard. Seasoning poor, too much tomato and burrata on the pizza ensured a soggy bottom. The tartare was made to spec on a separate station and then put into a ring, with all of (miserly) enlivening elements left at the bottom, not mixed in. Very similar to eating an expensive burger if the gas was off. All three wine glasses (one served with a patronising \u201care you sure?\u201d) were at different levels and ALL were smaller than the 125ml advertised. The very nice server, who has to stab the knives into a block rather than putting them next to the plate, was nice. He gave me free limoncello as an apology. It was 13.35.The whole experience felt like I was in a clip joint at a theme park or Leicester Square, not at a location suited for repeat custom from locals and cash strapped students. Real shame, as I will not be back to sample the, probably excellent, steaks.",

When we arrived the ambience was warm and welcoming and our noses were captured by a delicious smell of baked bread.We tried some battuta al gorgonzola and battuta all\u2019albese, both simply delicious.We noticed that incredibly deliciously looking pizzas were served and instead of the rump steak we switched for the pizza.I usually don\u2019t eat pizza if I don\u2019t know the place but this time I\u2019ve decided to trust the pizza chef, I had a good feeling.I ordered the one cooked with ice cubes on top, I was amazed about the idea, how genius are you to think about this?!My partner ordered the one with scamorza cheese and dried beef, I think it was called Snow White.The result was a creamy blend between dough and pecorino cheese, properly sprinkled with black pepper, an ecstatic concoction, I was shocked about how simple the ingredients they were but how gigantic was the result.The best part of it was the dough!!It was so soft, so light I couldn\u2019t believe.I normally struggle to digest pizza for diner, it makes me drink during the night and I usually have terrible nights but this time was different.Thank you guys, really well done!I\u2019m thankful expecially to the pizza chef that came out with the recipe for the dough, I will definitely be back!",

        "Review: A nice place with great staff, the decor and atmosphere are great escpecially upon entering the restaurant youre greeted by the home cured steak selection hanging in a chilled room. My points below are how i felt but i am definitely coming back to give it another go perhaps focusing more on the beef dishes instead of others. good points :- Staff are friendly and knowledgable- Food is authentic- Ambiance is nicePoints to take note :- Menu is a little pricey for what you get (a plate of pasta was around 15 pounds with almost no guanciale inside so not sure why it had to be 15 pounds) - food that came out wasnt hot, it was barely warm and more room temperature than anything. Reccomendations : - If you do come here, the food tastes good even if temperatures arent ideal, but stick to the steaks/beef. (the other dishes are really there to have a little diversity.)",

        "Review: Decided to try a new venue for lunch today with a colleague. We both ordered the pasta, which arrived warm not hot (editable) but was horribly over salted and for what we were served hugely overpriced. No sign of any meat or bone marrow (as the waiter described) on our plates. I always add salt to my food so my tolerance is pretty high for salt but this was literally like a mouth full of salt. Disgusting overpriced food. Portion was small so even if we had been able to enjoy the food we\u2019d still be hungry (as we were) after spend \u00a320 on lunch.",

The lardo bruschetta is the perfect balance of savoury and sweet, definitely one to try especially if you\u2019ve never eaten lardo. It\u2019s great that this branch does pizza because it makes for a great starter to share amongst friends. The pizza is very decent but the most interesting thing is the variety of toppings on offer. The meat is of course a show stopper. Cut and cooked per our specific instructions, bone in, of the highest quality fassona beef. So tender and marbled with the perfect level of dry aged umami taste. It blew us away. We have tried both the Fiorentina and the costata and we recommend the costata for anyone who likes a strong beef taste. The whole meal was paired with an excellent selection of red wines which just made everything better. The cherry on top was the great service from Nicola and the whole team, grazie mille! ",

        "Review: We've been twice to this place since it opened a few weeks ago and have really loved it each time. The first time we went was on a recommendation from an Italian friend who'd been to one of the other branches. We had the hanger steak & rump steak, both of which were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Possibly some of the best steak we've eaten in London. The desserts were also really delicious and the wine list had a good range. We were very pleasantly surprised by the cost - given the quality of the meat & cooking, dinner for two (shared starter & dessert, two steaks, two glasses of wine ~\u00a350).Based on this, we booked a birthday dinner for 12 people. The hospitality was brilliant - Lello (head butcher) came and talked us through the different types of meat on the menu, and made really good recommendations (as well as patiently accommodating our indecisive-ness!). The staff were really friendly, attentive and accommodating. The sharing steaks were really brilliant, again perfectly cooked. A couple of people had other things off the menu (pizza, soup) and also enjoyed their food a lot. A cool thing they also have is wine/prosecco by the magnum, which is a fun thing for a group. Also, the music they play is really upbeat and creates a really fun, warm atmosphere. Overall, highly recommend this place - works well for a couple as well as a group. Will probably be our 'go to' place for a nice evening out.",

        "Review: The ambience and hospitality of this place is great. The butcher, Lelo came to speak to our table and share with us his knowledge of meat, and cow raising. He also recommended our appetiser of cheese focaccia. The meat in this place is really really good, and so was the red wine ordered. I have to say I was disappointed by the foccacia appetiser as it was a thin flat bread (they said it is cooked with no yeast) with this soft cheese on top which to be honest is tasteless and just made the whole dish soggy. in addition, the focaccia was was burnt, at the top and a bit at the bottom making it taste like you were eating thin layers of charcoal. The pizza ordered was also not to be remembered as there was no party in my mouth. The potatoes that came with the steak were undercooked. However, if your aim is for hospitality and steak this is the right place. The staff is very nice, the Italian butcher gives it an authenticity that is hard to find and the decoration and ambience are very pleasant. The steak is excellent and maybe we just had a one-off experience with the elements that that I've written about about in this review.",

        "Review: This is, I think, the fifth branch of the Costa family\u2019s small chain of butcheries cum steakhouses. It\u2019s in the most unusual location a former petrol filling station a street or two behind the British Museum. Perhaps to that end its waiters were wearing rather industrial looking blue one piece jumpsuits although the waitresses were altogether more conventionally dressed. It also scores over some other branches by having room for its butchery inside without blocking the light from a front door or window as well as a substantial patio seating area outside. Steaks either rump, skirt or hanger in a single sIze but with different toppings or the likes of ribeye t-bone or fillet in different sizes are the thing. A pasta al pomodoro we ordered for my daughter, however, could not have been blander. The rabbit I ordered comprised some rather miscellaneous grilled pieces, again rather bland. If only it had been casseroled in a mustard sauce! The roast baby chicken my wife ordered was perhaps the best of an undistinctive bunch of dishes. Three breaded morcels of calves\u2019 brain placed in a paper tube made for a peculiar starter. Unlike other branches an extensive list of pizzas was in the menu here. But none were available as the pizza oven wasn\u2019t working. Service was so slow we decided to skip dessert and coffee.",
