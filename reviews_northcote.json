Went for friends birthday last night slow service took ages to get a drink and then we were given bread not even asked and later saw it was on the bill but two lots when we only got one.. the tuna unavailable on the starters.. no sauces available for the steaks! Nor the correct cheese for the burrata so it was substituted for mozzarella but no alteration to the bill! I ordered the prawn tagliatelle-sure it didn\u2019t even have any whole prawns it was chopped up bits of prawn maybe 2 and that was \u00a318! I was still hungry.. steaks were different sizes even though they were supposed to be the same! Massively overpriced for what it was, it was only because it was my friends birthday we didn\u2019t want to kick up too much fuss but we will never go there again! I feel massively ripped off! Just come back from Italy too and I have to say it didn\u2019t even compare.. disappointing avoid!!",

We order a pasta ( for my bf) and a roast baby chicken (for me). Pasta arrived a bit before my chicken but whatever. When I got my chicken I realized it was completely raw and pink inside. When I\u2019ve told the waitress she was very sorry and she apologized saying that she would take the chicken back to the kitchen. After 15 minutes of waiting she came back saying that the chicken would take 20 more minutes to cook so she asked me if I wanted something else. At the moment I was starving and my boyfriend had already finished his pasta so I asked her for the quickest main. She came back with a tagliata which was good. We were then charged for the all cost of the meal ( the tagliata of course was more expensive than the chicken) despite they serving me a raw chicken and us having eaten at different times but it was 50% off for the eat out scheme so didn\u2019t complain.

It has steak tartare, battuta all'albese, carpaccio, bresaola, cooked ham, salame and stracciatella.If I could make to love to something, this would be it!It is quite large and can easily be shared between four people. We then had a rib-eye steak with some roast potatoes and spinach. Well, what can I say about that steak...

        "Review: Please read this in the light-hearted tone in which it is intended; nothing personal against the charming and obliging staff is implied nor should be inferred.The regular 3 of us dropped by here on spec on Sunday 5th May intending to pass 30mins with a bottle of wine until Numero Uno opposite was up & running for the early evening. However, it seemed a nice ambience and the apparently complimentary plate of charcuterie pressed on us persuaded us to stay on for dinner.Unfortunately this place is in a chain (S. Ken, Clerkenwell, Bankside) that considers it necessary to have a \"Concept\", which the poor staff is obliged to explain.As this Concept unfolded, it became apparent that it mainly revolves around the fact that \"Chef\" will not cook the meat how you like it. It further transpired that the cutlery is removed, only to be returned by carefully placing the fork, then spearing the steak-knife into the table-top from a distance. It also involves already-dated-looking slates on boards.We felt it necessary to explain OUR concept: WE're paying - a Lot (see below) - so we'd like it at least medium-rare, please, or at least not so bloody that we had real health & safety concerns about the inch-thick lamb leg-steaks which despite this were not tender or especially tasty and the two of us simply gave up through a mixture of boredom and hard work cutting the meat. Our friend fared better with the rare filet steak.We'd also like clean crockery next time rather than re-used slates 'n' boards, ta.At \u00a3163-odd for 3 including 2 bottles of red, it wasn't a cheap experiment, so:Short Version - Unless you're a tiresome pass\u00e9 alpha-male who bores on about raw meat or you want to re-create the closing credits sequence of The Flintstones, content yourself with a few antipasti and a bottle one of the excellent nobiles.",

It is simply furnished - rustic, but comfortable none the less.The menu is beef orientated, an amazing array of cuts. (Chicken and intriguingly rabbit made it to the menu, but given the focus it seemed churlish to choose anything but beef). Orders taken our waitress (helpful and knowledgeable on the cuts, sourcing etc.) returned with the appropriate cutlery. The steak knives were driven into the table like a medieval banquet.My friend and I shared a couple of starters - which were good.For my main I had a hanger steak rubbed with herbs and 'smoke'. Thought this was a bit of a gimmick but no. My meal arrived under an opaque dome, which when lifted was indeed smoke. Wonderfully theatrical, wonderfully tasty. Probably the best stake I've ever had.

        "Review: This place has much to commend it \u2013 high quality and Italian.The interior is distinctly quirky and very welcoming. Service is great.There is a wide range of wines. If you are not expert in Italian wines, take their advice, as there is plenty of choice.Love the menu. There is an emphasis on meat, but vegetarians can get a good dinner. Portion sizes are good and pricing is mid-range for what you get.There are so many details... Lovely homemade pasta, blowtorched gorgonzola on battuta, brilliant bone marrow and a tasty smoke flourish on the hanger steak.A very enjoyable experience.",

        "Review: Its speciality are steaks, which you chose raw and they cook. The steaks are priced by raw uncooked weight (so you need more than you think) and, having agreed a weight, the steak they brought to the table for our approval was a bit heavier than we were recommended - funny that. Sides are not included and are \u00a34.90 extra each. To its credit, the T-bone steak was superbly cooked and the battuta zola starter was out of this world. There is plenty of non-steak choice which is reasonably priced. The wine list is pricey and a 12.5% service charge is added. Ultra efficient manager held the service together because his waiting staff were clueless, comically so. A fun and original concept but, for what it is, pricey. Small number of covers won\u2019t help the per capita economics, but it does make for a cosy atmosphere. ",

        "Review: Friendly welcoming and knowledgable staff but food was disappointing and lacked flavour. We had croquettes to start with that were incredibly bland and tasteless.I had a ribeye steak that for some reason came cut up. The meat was bland and underwhelming. The staff seemed proud to say the meat has nearly no fat in it. This is not what makes steak tasty, so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be proud of that. The steak wasn\u2019t even flame grilled. REALLY disappointing especially for a \u00a330 steak. My partner had a ragu pasta that also simply lacked depth and flavour. Tasted very two dimensional. I also order a glass of wine at \u00a311 that was well below a standard 175ml glass. Very underwhelmed for a pricey meal. Avoid. ",

        "Review: In questo ottimo ristorante si mangia della vera cucina italiana.Non \u00e8 la classica cucina di pasta e pizza ma si trova dell'ottima carne, fiorentine e tagliate oltre a pochi primi selezionati.Assaggiate i ravioli al brasato sono eccezionali saporiti e con un vero sugo, non di carne trita ma di carne cotta e insaporita per ore che si scioglie in bocca. Le tagliatelle sono un pochino spesse ma il sugo \u00e8 veramente buono.La tartare, su un letto di cipolle, o la pi\u00f9 semplice battuta di fassona sono semplicemente deliziose, per la qualit\u00e0 e il trattamento della materia prima.Ho evitato le tagliate pi\u00f9 elaborate con gorgonzola e vari condimenti, pi\u00f9 adatti al mercato inglese, per ripiegare su quella semplice all'olio e sale grosso, la cottura era un po meno che media ma la carne era tenerissima.Carta dei vini molto buona, abbiamo bevuto un barbera onesto ad un prezzo accettabile.Non si spende pochissimo ma le materie prime sono di qualit\u00e0.Eravamo con due bambini piccoli che sono stati vezzeggiati da tutto il personale.Per sottofondo compilation di musica italiana anni dal 70 in poi.",

So far so good.Then I look toward the kitchen pass and notice a young member of staff, he was looking at us and mumbling words in ITALIAN, unfortunately for him I am also italian and I understood everything he said, he was really rude and vulgar towards us. We being called DIC.....DS and we were blamed to disturb him during a quite time.I couldn't believe my ears, I guess if you cannot stand people coming to your restaurant to spend money you should try a different job as in the hospitality there is lots of interaction with people.I got really angry and told him that I speak italian, I may have told him off in a fashionable way (apologies for that), then we left.The manager looked truly sorry but I guess hour pre-dinner drink got spoiled.Shame, the restaurant looks great and the reviews were all positive, unfortunately I will never have a chance to try after this appalling experience.",

        "Review: Went for dinner at Macellaio on the basis of recommendations of the South Ken branch.Firstly, the location. The restaurant is towards the far end of Northcote Rd and is a long way from the bustle near Battersea Rise.The Smell: I appreciate that this is a steak restaurant, but I do not want to be overwhelmed by the smell of meat as I sit at my table, it is more pungent than the Doves butcher not too far away and was intensified as the staff pulled in more meet from the window display, it actually put me off my food.The Food: Whilst the food in principal was good, there has be a a question to the logic of offering a 1.6kg rib and then trying to cook it with the bone on - the centre was rare, which was delicious, but the outside retained the texture of biltong from the hanging process, it appeared not to have been pan fried at all - a bit of a disappointment. The starters and puddings were good though.Service: Not particularly good, it started well but given there were only 3 tables including ours, it seemed very slow and stilted.The price: for \u00a375 I would expect a little more. There are better options in the immediate vicinity, including Roxy that would be 30% cheaper. Overall: I was expecting far more from a chain which is held in such high regard. I do not expect to return any time soon and I would chose Roxy over Macellaio every time. That said, I hope this was a one off and other diners have had better a experience, especially the over powering smell of raw blood and beef.",

From the beginning the service was impeccable (young Italian lady with brown hair - cant remember her name!) from offering Aperitifs to helping us decide on the cut of meat and wine to pair it with. We ordered the croquettes which were delicious, but the charcuterie board with the pezzo di lardo paired with honey and walnut was sublime! With three hungry guys on the table, they ordered 1.5kg of the T-Bone which tasted (i nicked a little bit) amazing, the flavours was so intense and definitely worth while. The other three had two ribeye steaks, the Gorgonzola with walnut butter was delicious and so was the chicken - both packed with flavour.There are some expensive wines on the menu, but we opted for a \u00a332 bottle, which did not disappoint. The waitress was great in explaining which wines she thought we would appreciate based on our tastes, and she got it very right!Normally when the food is so good, the desserts to not match up to the standard, however the desserts here are a must. The apple cake, milk and Nutella balls and the cheesecake were also great.Although the food is brilliant, i would have to say, the highlight was our waitress, who managed to entertain the three guys that were joking around with her for the entire evening about French wine and Italian mannerisms.Definitely worth a trip, but make sure you book in advance!",

        "Review: Vado al macellaio di Northcote Road pieno di aspettative: colleghi gourmet che hanno visitato il ristorante di South Kensington me me parlano in termini semplicemente entusiastici.La prima piccola delusione arriva quando ci accomodiamo: l'arredamento non sembra molto curato, i tavoli sono microscopici e infatti mangiare sar\u00e0 un'impresa.. mah, mi dico, hanno aperto da poco e lo spazio a Londra costa caro si sa..Il men\u00f9 invece \u00e8 un capolavoro di essenzialit\u00e0: non troppi piatti, eppure hai la sensazione che non manchi niente tra antipasti, primi e soprattutto carne.Fantastica la carta dei vini, naturalmente tutta italiana, con prevalenza di Toscana e Piemonte come forse si addice ad un locale specializzato in carne.Servizio cortese e professionale, tutto italiano, con tanto di entratina offerta (una focaccia in po' triste e qualche fetta di buon salame).Ma veniamo alla carne. Ordiniamo una rump steak all gorgonzola e noci e una skirt steak in salsa di funghi e parsnip croccanti.La rump \u00e8 molta buona, grigliata alla perfezione e perfettamente rispettosa della cottura richiesta, il gorgonzola \u00e8 solo un piccolo pezzetto a lato con UNA noce (mi aspettavo una salsa). La skirt steak invece \u00e8 cotta lentamente in sottovuoto (o sous vide come in maniera molto posh mi spiegano), ma la consistenza resta ahim\u00e8 un po' gommosa e la salsa non troppo riuscita per i miei gusti. Per completare, un'insalata di cavolo rosso con guanciale croccante e un bicchiere di Etna Rosso (migliorato notevolmente dall'apertura della bottiglia a una decina di minuti dopo).Il conto \u00e8 di \u00a350 in due, che in principio ci sta, ma quello che ci ha stupito \u00e8 la dimensione delle porzioni. Una rump da \u00a316 da si e no 100 gr, per quanto di carne italianissima (lo do per scontato), resta un prezzo un po' alto anche per Londra per un main che ti lascia comunque un po' affamato. Ma insomma anche il resto \u00e8 tarato al rialzo: la pi\u00f9 modesta skirt steak costava comunque intorno ai \u00a315, l'insalata addirittura \u00a34.90, i vini al calice mediamente \u00a38-10 (calice piccolo). Servizio del 12.5% obbligatorio anche per tavoli piccoli.La sensazione finale \u00e8 di aver mangiato bene, ma non in maniera eccezionale, e di aver pagato un po' troppo. Le mille potenzialit\u00e0 di questo locale possono essere svelate solo mettendo mano, seriamente, al portafogli. E allora resti un po' col dubbio: ma ne vale davvero la pena? Per la mia cena di ieri sera, la risposta \u00e8 un sommesso \"ni\", pur non mettendo assolutamente in discussione la qualit\u00e0 del lavoro e dei prodotti.",

        "Review: We arrived on time at 630pm on a Friday evening, having been informed when we made booking we would have to give up the table at 830pm. I have never warmed to this concept of two sittings of an evening and more often than not, do not book a table if it is a pricey restaurant. On this occasion I was not the one making the booking.We had a cosy, quiet table towards to the rear close to the bar, it is not a big place but the tables are set apart comfortably. The staff were absolutely lovely, attentive and very friendly. We ordered a good variety of starters and were also given a tray of mortadella and well made bread. The steak tartare was exceptional, as was the liver cooked in butter and sage and also the testicles sauteed in lard. We had a a couple of carafes of fine red and an excellent sauvignon blanc, wines were pricey but not shockingly so. For mains 3 of us shared a 1kg rib of beef, it was brought to the table prior to cooking and arrived later under a huge silver dome. We ordered several portions of fries, 1 baby chicken and one vegetarian Trenette pasta dish which was nice enough but not exceptional. The red meat was a HUGE hit and devoured. Desserts of fried milk - very good, , tiramasu - ok, chocolate cake - surprisingly very good and an excellent cheeseboard all went down very well. The cheeseboard came with no crackers/bread we had to ask. Something like a Sicilian flatbread would have been a perfect accompaniment. It was an expensive meal but if you like good meat this is definitely worth giving a go. Besides you don't have to go over board, it is easy to order carefully and eat just as well. And to top it all, we were never asked to vacate the table and left when we were ready. A pleasant evening.",

        "Review: I don't eat meat often so when I do I make sure I choose well.The restaurant\u2019s specialty is Fassone beef from Italy which is probably one of the best beef on the block. I was surprised by the carnivorous menu, indeed, as a starter, there were not many choices and we did not want to have charcuteries, steak tartare or carpaccio if we were to enjoy some steak afterward, we, therefore, went for the soup as it was the only vegetarian option. Fortunately, this soup was a delight.The main is a mixture of offals, grilled meat or pasta. I had the rump steak and my friend while the beef shoulder, both dishes were tasty and tender and low in fat, especially the beef shoulder. Additionally, they just serve the right amount so no food was wasted! Our sides were also excellent and my dessert was to die for. On the negative side, our waitress was lovely but did not understand or speak English, so the communication was a bit difficult, also, more starters options should be offered as having meat both for starters and for the main is a bit too much!I would go back and would definitely recommend this place, especially for meat-lovers.",

        "Review: Huge window frames huge chucks of meat and inside there's a delicatessen with a range of cold cuts and steaks. The room is jack packed with tables and chairs so you have to be careful where you go!I arrived for the soft opening and ordered the carpaccio - this was well seasoned no generously portioned and accompanied with a fruity olive oil - simply divine! I ordered some bread (which was a bit stale) but worked to soak the oil and pieces of beef on top. The beef just melts on your mouth - hmmmThe rump steak was already sliced and accompanied with a very limp dish of rocket and Parmesan which I just ignored as it would simply take away from the steak. I also had the French beans with breadcrumbs for texture and the tasty potatoes that were flavoured with rosemary - a very good dish. I think I'll order a slab of steak next time as I prefer to cut my own steak but it's pretty pricy.I finished with a tiramisu which the staff raved on about but I had better, more memorable versions in another restaurant down the same road.As it was a soft opening, the bill was half priced which was very reasonable and I think full priced is fine for the quality of the meat. The staff were lovely and the manager, Alberto took the time to explain different cuts, where the meat was from, etc. He also didn't charge me for the tiramisu to make up for the rocket salad. What I would change is the \"plates\", i.e. The blocks of wood - there's no room to cut your food and sometimes it feels unbalanced. Really annoying!",

Cooked to perfection, my wife said she didnt mind it being on the rare side with meat that good. couple of downsides - the tables in the front are quite narrow - we sat in the middle and got hit several times by handbags and wide hips! not helped by smokers coming in and out. The office is in a small cubby hole with a 100w light bulb - quite off putting late at night when you are enjoying a romantic meal. The cheesecake is good but felt the berries could have been fresher. it was nice to hear about the 'older cow' theory and the Italian artisan farm it came from - it definitely seemed to work!",

A bottle of Spanish red recommended by the waiter was beautiful.My only tiny whine is they don't serve sauces. The meat doesn't need it, I agree - it was beautiful without - but I still would prefer the option to have a sauce on the side which I could use occasionally and for my chips!

        "Review: This is, I think, the fourth Macellaio to have opened in London in recent years, the others being in Old Brompton Road, Clerkenwell and underneath the arches in Union Street, Southwark. This one towards the southern end of Northcote Road replacing Rosina's Sherry Bar (a failure as both a business and a concept) is the closest to our home in Wandsworth. It feels more like a butchers' than a restaurant much of the small space in the front room occupied by a large display case full of raw meat carcasses. Behind a screen blocks the window thus rendering the interior rather gloomy. As part of the soft opening I was expecting it to be much fuller than it was this lunchtime given the Open Table reservations site suggested there were currently no tables available. It majors in steaks. A male couple at another table shared a rib steak cooked on the bone for \u00a330. We were less adventurous. Absent any children's menu my daughter had ravioli with a herby ragu from the main menu. My steak tartare starter lacked seasoning and could have had egg yolk added. Bollita croquettes with chocolate were a tad wacky. It was good to see rabbit on the menu and my wife enjoyed her assorted pieces served on a tray with a yoghurty sauce. My rump steak came unexpectedly sliced. Desserts namely a chocolate slice and a Bianco di Basilica (a sort of Italian take on crema Catalana) were memorable; espressos exemplary. But even with a 50% reduction on food the bill was still in excess of \u00a383, partly because the 500ml carafe of 'house' wine cost \u00a329 whilst portions of chips and roast potatoes were around \u00a35 each. Service was efficient and polite throughout.",

However the service is slick and you couldn't tell it was soft opening week.We were given some amazing complimentary slices of beef which was melt in the mouth and to my relief my date was looking forward to the rest.For starters he had the tatiki which was seared rump steak (absolutely delicious) cooked to perfection. I had the Macellaio salad which was pure heaven. Beautiful ingredients which sang for themselves.For mains we had the rib of beef to share cooked rare. The beef was of superior quality and we were gutted it was finished! Sides were bit of let down. We had some lovely Barbera D.O.C wine which was a perfect accompaniment to the meat. Dessert menu was slightly disappointing. Even with the soft opening offer we paid \u00a3120 for two starters, main, sides and a bottle of wine. So it's not cheap (especially considering the restaurant itself is nothing special). But the ingredients are truly special. As are the lovely staff.
