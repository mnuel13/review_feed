        "Title: Disappointing",
        "Review: I brought my friend here after many happy experiences at Macellaio (all the branches, including the one just opened in theatreland).Macellaio was a real place for foodies, with beautiful cuts of meat - not just steaks but delicious offal like marrow and tongue.Sadly I find out they\u2019ve removed the offal from the menu. Maybe they\u2019ve dumbed down, I thought; but no matter, I decide to order the Genovese pesto trofie, since I had rated Macellaio\u2019s highly.I then get a bowl of tasteless trofie with rough cut dark basil floating amidst whole pine nuts. There was no emulsion of cheese, garlic and pounded basil. Just some basil chopped and covered on the trofie. Apart from the faint taste of garlic, the trofie was tasteless.I can\u2019t believe Macellaio has gone down so far. My companion\u2019s steak was good, as was the friendly service, but for these prices they shouldn\u2019t be serving this kind of food.",

        "Review: From start to finish the experience and food here was appalling We were a large table of 10 pre booked to celebrate my brothers 30th birthday, we arrived on time and the restaurant was relatively empty- we noticed there was only 2 members of staff serving, fine we thought. It took us nearly an hour to be served drinks\u2026 when we asked the waitress she said \u201coh I am taking your order altogether\u201d I have not experienced any other restaurant do this! The waitress then had to also create the drinks as well as serve the food and take orders etc so when people are ordering varying different wines/ cocktails etc is time consumingThe starters turned up, my husbands burrata and ham starter has plastic in it- this was taken off the bill and appreciate accidents do happen but wasn\u2019t impressed.Mains arrived - sides were served first as well as the larger sharing steaks- this meant these items went Cold whilst waiting for the other diners food to arrive. The steak I had was mediocre at best- it was chewy and not medium rare at all- it was quite rare. The spinach was neither garlicy or buttery- again this was removed from the bill. I have the say the lamb rack was lovely (I shared with my other half between that and a steak) Overall we left disappointed and actually frustrated that we had paid so much for something so poor. If you are charging \u00a370 for a steak you would expect it to be at least warm.In addition - there was a constant smell of \u201cbins\u201d we were quite near to where they cut the meat but still it was vile and very off putting when eating.The waitress could have pointed out that the sides are quite large and easily shareable - rather than get us to order quite a few at \u00a37 a pop mostly it isn\u2019t exactly cheap. Would not return overall.",

        "Review: This is not the first time we had dinner at Il Macellaio RC restaurant which has several restaurants in London and every time we had an amazing food.On Saturday 2nd April we had dinner at the Fitzrovia branch and we ordered a Costata steak and some roast potatoes. Half Steak was full of fat. Also the colour and taste was like a meat cooked in the oven and NOT a grilled meat!!!!!. The roast potatoes, which are usually excellent, were slightly crunchy and very chewy.I admit that the waiter was very kindly and immediately removed 50% of the cost of the steak from the bill.For a restaurant of this level, a dinner of a certain quality is expected.",

We also enjoyed a perfect tiramis\u00f9.We were looked after by Vincenzo, very attentive and prepared: he was able to suggest the best dishes on the menu with competence and genuine interest for the client. A perfect experience with great food, warm staff in a nice restaurant decor. The prices are in line with the quality of the food and the service. Thank you again to Macellaio and Vincenzo for the great evening.",

        "Review: We dropped in to this restaurant on spec. There were tables outside, and we were immediately made to feel welcome. The location is on a quiet side street. It's the forecourt of a former garage, there's a wall and fence separating the out door tables from the pavement, so it's quite secluded, while still being outdoors.The menu is italian dishes, mostly meat based.There is steak served various ways, including steak tartare, roast chicken, and other meat dishes. I'm not a great meat-eater. Our waiter helpfully pointed out the vegetarian dishes on the menu, and offered variations on some other dishes. I had a pasta dish with basil, which was delicious. My carnivourous companion enjoyed a steak with rocket and parmesan. The whole meal was served with a pleasing element of theatre. It was a good experience which we will repeat. Many thanks to our waiter Dennis for his attention, advice and friendly service.",

        "Review: We got to the restaurant with a reservation, and as a start we had to wait 30 minutes to get the table, with a \u2018false\u2019 it will be ready in 5 minutes promise. While waiting at the bar, we were also completely left alone and they did not even ask if we wanted a drink while waiting! After that, we finally get the table and order starters, Fiorentina and 2 bottles of wine, almost getting the night on track again. When at the end of this, we ask for the classic limoncello to digest the big meal and the manager said we could not get it because it was 10 min too late. We insisted explaining that in a restaurant we would not expect time restriction on alcol until it is open, and the 10 min late was a)not communicated by her with our last order b) we ordered our last wine bottle of time already later than her \u2018too late\u2019 time c) the 10 min delay was completely their fault for making us wait. To summarise, food was ok, but manager service was the worst I have seen in years in London! ",

Accoglienza molto calorosa, locale molto carino con esposizione di vari tagli di carne e cantina ben fornita con ottimi vini italiani. Abbiamo provato il carpaccio e le bruschette con lardo, tutto ottimo. Siamo poi passati alla scelta della carne che ci \u00e8 stata scrupolosamente spiegata e presentata per conferma prima della cottura. Abbiamo optato per un paio di costate che, una volta cotte, abbiamo divorato da tanto che erano buone. Abbiamo provato anche alcuni dolci, il tiramis\u00f9 e il latte dolce, entrambi ottimi. Ad un certo punto, senza alcun preavviso, lo staff ci ha fatto una graditissima sorpresa presentandosi al tavolo cantando \u201ctanti auguri\u201d ed offrendoci due piccoli dolci con relativa candelina per i due festeggiati. Abbiamo passato una bellissima serata e ringrazio tutto lo staff per il servizio che ci ha dedicato. Complimenti a tutti, continuate cos\u00ec. Ovviamente super consigliato.",

Overall a fun restaurant with a nice ambience, it has wine cellars and an industrial look about it.Starters were very good including the platter option which includes everything.

        "Review: We saw Macellaio on the list of best stakehouses of London from a magazine, and decided to book for a Friday night dinner. It was a great idea. The outlet in Fitzrovia (in an otherwise unassuming area) has been transformed from a into a fantastic meat place. No focus on decoration but on quality food, meat and great staff. We had for starters an Imperial\u2019s plate, a selection of their best, which was really great. If you would choose individual starters, go for carpaccio or one of the variations of steak tatare, but really there was no weak point in this. We had than a ca. 1kg rib steak medium rare, the meat 7-9 week dry-aged. Like it should be, fantastic. For dessert, we tried tiramisu (homemade, one of the best tried so far) and the vertical selection of parmigiano reggiano (12-24-36 and 72 months aged), really interesting to try. They also have pizzas which would be good to try as pizza bread was great, but this time we really had no capacity for that. Finally, but most important, our host, Farzana was the highlight of the night, attentive, competent, professional and cheerful. Definitely a place to visit if you look for quality steaks and good atmosphere in London.",

To be honest, as the dishes are the same in all Macellaio\u2019s restaurant, to makes the difference is Vincenzo. He is very good in what he does and his professionalism is unrivalled. Vincenzo treat us, and for what I saw everybody, as a very single person is special and you feel important because he not just remember you but remember also your name.

        "Review: Per festeggiare il compleanno di mia figlia, che vive a Londra, ci siamo recati in questo ristorante che avevamo visto in un programma televisivo. Le aspettative erano alte e sono state soddisfatte. Ambiente carino, carne in vista, personale gentilissimo reale, qui cosa rarissima anche in ristoranti italiani quasi che l\u2019indifferenza, la freddezza, fossero malattie epidemiche. Ottimi gli antipasti, tartare una semplice, una alla tartara e una servita sull\u2019osso col suo midollo passati in forno, un tagliere di cotto e stracciatella, accompagnati con schiacciatina ottima, Fiorentina , per 3 persone, di kg.1,2 , di chianina piemontese, cottura al sangue perfetta, tenerissima perch\u00e9 frollata dalle 7 alle 9 settimane, filetto al sangue con parmigiano e rucola, pizza ai 4 formaggi fiammeggiata al tavolo, 2 insalate di finocchi e arance, buona anche se un po\u2019 marinata e quindi finocchi mosci, patate al forno, normali,2 cheesecake con salsa ai mirtilli, un tiramis\u00f9 ed un ananas, 5 1/2 minerali e 2 calici di Chianti, normale cio\u00e8 senza lode ne infamia, 5 coperti, 260 \u00a3. Onestissimo, considerando la citt\u00e0 che offre ristorazione realmente scadente, con carni che noi non porteremmo a casa neanche se ce le regalassero. Inoltre, saputo del compleanno, ci hanno offerto, a sorpresa, un calice di vino all\u2019arrivo e un dolce con candelina e canzone di buon compleanno x mia figlia. L\u2019unica pecca, da qui le 4 approvazioni invece di 5, il filetto era tenerissimo ma a media cottura e non al sangue e, purtroppo, l\u2019osso nel taglio della Fiorentina non era stato preciso ma ripetuto, di conseguenza si \u00e8 sbriciolato facendocene trovare frammenti nelle carni.

It was absolutely a 10 out of 10 experience! First of all I really appreciate the hospitality of Ilaria, one of the smilest and accomodating receptionist that I ever bump into. Thanks to her and her ability we could stay a bit longer at the table even if my husband (as always) was late.During my waiting, I been entertained by Vicenzo which got me through to the story of the meat that they selected (Fassona, one of the best meat that Italy got to offer) and also introduced me the menu, given me all the right tips for my order later on. My partner doesn't like red wine unfortunatly and thanks to the knowledge of the staff we opted for a nice Franciacorta of Antinori for our special occasion. SO GOOD !

        "Review: I was looking forward to having dinner here, after my first dinner at Maxell\u00e2 in my native hometown, Genoa, years ago.Unfortunately our dinner has been fairly disappointing.It all started perfectly, as my wife\u2019s burrata and my tartare (battuta all\u2019Albese) were awesome. However, our mains were flawed. My wife\u2019s pasta with pesto was incredibly salty, while my rump steak, a tiny portion, should have come with gorgonzola and walnuts but it came just with some cubes of sea salt. When I pointed out the missing cheese and walnuts, my dish was taken and given back with a lump of cold gorgonzola and some walnuts. Not exactly the sort of meat with melting cheese that I was, maybe wrongly, expecting.The desserts were good, as well as the wine and the dessert wines, but all wines are truly expensive and the total bill, which includes a service charge too, is close to a one Michelin star Italian restaurant that we know in our new hometown, Maidenhead, and which is way better than this one.Definitely completely different from the original Maxell\u00e2 that I knew in Genoa, somehow pretentious unlike the very basic style of the Genoa restaurant, and all background music was just reggaeton which has no relationship whatsoever with the original context of all food served there.",

        "Review: The wonderful Concierge Team, Sean & Richard at the nearby Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel, Russell Square highly recommended Macellaio Fitzrovia to us upon our very detailed requirements that we wanted an independent, high-end Italian, that oozed style & Italian authenticity, which was located close-by & within walking distance from the Hotel! Wow wow wow simply sums up Macellaio & it certainly ticked all our boxes! It\u2019s so quirky, quaint, occupying a building which we later understood to be London\u2019s first petrol station & to that end, the Proprietor\u2019s have styled & designed the venue with a clear nod to its\u2019 mechanical history; with cutlery sets being displayed & featured upon long screws & bolts & with the Waiters wearing formula one, Grand Prix-style jumpsuits. Additionally all the table tops feature Italian automotive brands, Fiat, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo etc & some of the seating has been constructed from wooden wine boxes & adorned with funky cushions for style & comfort. It\u2019s entire interior is modern & fun & absolutely immaculately spotless throughout; especially the restroom facilities which is always an indicative test for me! We were welcomed like old Friends, despite having never been before & immediately accommodated, although Sean @ the Kimpton Fitzroy had made an impromptu reservation upon our behalf & it literally took less than ten minutes to stroll across Russell Square through the University buildings to reach Macellaio; whose name & signage is lit up like a west-end show! Other trendy, original aspects of Macellaio were the newspaper-styled menus; such a unique concept & a real show of individuality. Further, we were delighted to have stumbled across happy hour which is actually two hours, 6-8pm for certain drinks priced at just \u00a35 each; so a few Aperol Spritz were enjoyed as we surveyed the menus & absorbed the eclectic venue. We were only in the market for a pasta supper, having enjoyed a huge three course lunch earlier that day at Quaglino\u2019s; but the steaks & carne is without doubt the speciality of this really very special establishment, since it features its\u2019 very own butchery counter displaying all the sustainably & traceable meat in gloriously spectacular cabinets & we can not wait to return to sample the Macellaio specialities. It was a seemingly wonderful experience for Diners to have their respective meat choice presented to them at the table prior to cooking & the pomp & ceremony surrounding the sharing steak with the shiner cloche was a sight to behold & also such a fabulously unique style in which to served Guests. We had the tagliettelle ragu, along with the stuffed ravioli with spinach & ragu, a leaf salad & a pizza-style garlic bread, washed down with a few glasses of red! Perfecto! Everything was beautifully presented & utterly delicious; just exquisite Italian food fayre at its\u2019 finest. Grazie mille all! We will return very soon. X ",

They have a lovely cabinet full of excellent beef and a pizza oven but failed to make Tartare or pizza to an acceptable standard. Seasoning poor, too much tomato and burrata on the pizza ensured a soggy bottom. The tartare was made to spec on a separate station and then put into a ring, with all of (miserly) enlivening elements left at the bottom, not mixed in. Very similar to eating an expensive burger if the gas was off. All three wine glasses (one served with a patronising \u201care you sure?\u201d) were at different levels and ALL were smaller than the 125ml advertised. The very nice server, who has to stab the knives into a block rather than putting them next to the plate, was nice. He gave me free limoncello as an apology. It was 13.35.The whole experience felt like I was in a clip joint at a theme park or Leicester Square, not at a location suited for repeat custom from locals and cash strapped students. Real shame, as I will not be back to sample the, probably excellent, steaks.",

My points below are how i felt but i am definitely coming back to give it another go perhaps focusing more on the beef dishes instead of others. good points :- Staff are friendly and knowledgable- Food is authentic- Ambiance is nicePoints to take note :- Menu is a little pricey for what you get (a plate of pasta was around 15 pounds with almost no guanciale inside so not sure why it had to be 15 pounds) - food that came out wasnt hot, it was barely warm and more room temperature than anything. Reccomendations : - If you do come here, the food tastes good even if temperatures arent ideal, but stick to the steaks/beef. (the other dishes are really there to have a little diversity.)",

        "Review: Everything we had to eat was unbelievably good. Like truly breath taking, hard to come by quality of food. The lardo bruschetta is the perfect balance of savoury and sweet, definitely one to try especially if you\u2019ve never eaten lardo. It\u2019s great that this branch does pizza because it makes for a great starter to share amongst friends. The pizza is very decent but the most interesting thing is the variety of toppings on offer. The meat is of course a show stopper. Cut and cooked per our specific instructions, bone in, of the highest quality fassona beef. So tender and marbled with the perfect level of dry aged umami taste. It blew us away. We have tried both the Fiorentina and the costata and we recommend the costata for anyone who likes a strong beef taste. The whole meal was paired with an excellent selection of red wines which just made everything better. The cherry on top was the great service from Nicola and the whole team, grazie mille! ",

        "Title: Dinner date & birthday dinner",
        "Review: We've been twice to this place since it opened a few weeks ago and have really loved it each time. The first time we went was on a recommendation from an Italian friend who'd been to one of the other branches. We had the hanger steak & rump steak, both of which were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Possibly some of the best steak we've eaten in London. The desserts were also really delicious and the wine list had a good range. We were very pleasantly surprised by the cost - given the quality of the meat & cooking, dinner for two (shared starter & dessert, two steaks, two glasses of wine ~\u00a350).Based on this, we booked a birthday dinner for 12 people. The hospitality was brilliant - Lello (head butcher) came and talked us through the different types of meat on the menu, and made really good recommendations (as well as patiently accommodating our indecisive-ness!). The staff were really friendly, attentive and accommodating. The sharing steaks were really brilliant, again perfectly cooked. A couple of people had other things off the menu (pizza, soup) and also enjoyed their food a lot. A cool thing they also have is wine/prosecco by the magnum, which is a fun thing for a group. Also, the music they play is really upbeat and creates a really fun, warm atmosphere. Overall, highly recommend this place - works well for a couple as well as a group. Will probably be our 'go to' place for a nice evening out.",

        "Title: Great hospitality and steaks",
        "Review: The ambience and hospitality of this place is great. The butcher, Lelo came to speak to our table and share with us his knowledge of meat, and cow raising. He also recommended our appetiser of cheese focaccia. The meat in this place is really really good, and so was the red wine ordered. I have to say I was disappointed by the foccacia appetiser as it was a thin flat bread (they said it is cooked with no yeast) with this soft cheese on top which to be honest is tasteless and just made the whole dish soggy. in addition, the focaccia was was burnt, at the top and a bit at the bottom making it taste like you were eating thin layers of charcoal. The pizza ordered was also not to be remembered as there was no party in my mouth. The potatoes that came with the steak were undercooked. However, if your aim is for hospitality and steak this is the right place. The staff is very nice, the Italian butcher gives it an authenticity that is hard to find and the decoration and ambience are very pleasant. The steak is excellent and maybe we just had a one-off experience with the elements that that I've written about about in this review.",

        "Title: Filling station but don\u2019t stray from the steaks",
        "Review: This is, I think, the fifth branch of the Costa family\u2019s small chain of butcheries cum steakhouses. It\u2019s in the most unusual location a former petrol filling station a street or two behind the British Museum. Perhaps to that end its waiters were wearing rather industrial looking blue one piece jumpsuits although the waitresses were altogether more conventionally dressed. It also scores over some other branches by having room for its butchery inside without blocking the light from a front door or window as well as a substantial patio seating area outside. Steaks either rump, skirt or hanger in a single sIze but with different toppings or the likes of ribeye t-bone or fillet in different sizes are the thing. A pasta al pomodoro we ordered for my daughter, however, could not have been blander. The rabbit I ordered comprised some rather miscellaneous grilled pieces, again rather bland. If only it had been casseroled in a mustard sauce! The roast baby chicken my wife ordered was perhaps the best of an undistinctive bunch of dishes. Three breaded morcels of calves\u2019 brain placed in a paper tube made for a peculiar starter. Unlike other branches an extensive list of pizzas was in the menu here. But none were available as the pizza oven wasn\u2019t working. Service was so slow we decided to skip dessert and coffee.",

The restaurant specializes in meat dishes, mainly beef, but with some others, such as rabbit. The starters looked good but we were short of time so had entree and dessert. We had filet steak, hanger steak and a pizza. For dessert we had Latte Dolce Frito (which were divine), cheesecake and Tiramisu. All were very good. The staff were very friendly and attentive but not overpowering so. We will be going again.",
